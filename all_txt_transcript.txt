China_Band_5_105782	my grandparents' work job is history teacher in the middle school yeah multiple people think the teacher should be very serious and very hard working but I think he was very happy everyday because maybe his he was keen on his job he was pretty enjoy history I think his his work just told students about some history what happened when did these things happen and some special war and when who and characters and what after this war which influences what will be the truth yeah I think this is my grandparents only job when I was middle school I don't likes history because he to recite many details and some people's name but but my parent my grandparent can talk of told me a story that a story that you can understand easy and you can interest in in these things like three kingdoms yeah it's very interesting for me so many primary school students like a hero like a character characters in a hero in them heart their hearts yes
China_Band_5_105790	okay the place I went with my friend and have a good time it was after I graduate from the the junior high school and I went with my friends and I went to the America with my friends I I I went to some of the some place of Americas one of make me real impressed is Seattle because it was a really beautiful place and we went to we enjoyed the good weather the and the the good environment the good place and and local people were very friendly and we visited a large market it was full of very fresh fruits vegetables and fish and especially the fish they were just in the sea and and transported into this market so it was very fresh for me I am cook lover so for me that's what heaven for me and the other place I very impressed is we went to the the theme park the Universe it was very
China_Band_5_105800	well for this part I would like to talk about Suzhou Yuanlin I have seen I have been there a couple times because my parents workplace is not far from there and The Suzhou yuan the Suzhou gardens is also located in Suzhou Suzhou City which is located in Zhejiang province and when it's talk about the building looks like the building the Suzhou yuan the Suzhou garden always contain a pond that that there are many goldfishes and and many sceneries and there also many walkways and and trees which combine with nature and ancient cultural as for the oh as for the houses the houses of Suzhou garden always have white wall and black tiles and and always decorated with many art works this this history building used to exclusive property of nobles and rich people but now it's regard as a scenery spot in Suzhou city and and why I would like to learn more about this
China_Band_6_108416	okay the best theory I've received I'm going to talk about is happened in the restaurant that with the spitting distance of my home I go to the restaurant mainly because it is very near from my house and very convenient for but the last weeks experience just really really disturbed me and when I got when I first got to the restaurant it was a Chinese restaurant and there is no one at the door to welcome me in after I got my seat I asked for the waiter to give me the menu but I've wait for maybe five or ten minutes and then can't see the menu and I can't order anything and then after I order just a noodle and they make me wait for many times and I don't think the service they have is prompt and they treat me not friendly I think it's a very very bad experience and also the food it's taste not good and I don't think it's fresh enough so I think this experience I have in this restaurant is really bad and it frustrated me
China_Band_6_108422	okay thank you outdoor sport or an outdoor sport I'd like to try for the first time is is surfing because I went to England and I saw many people also my friends they do wind surfing or normal surfing yeah because my city is only the it's around the sea it's at the beach so I think that's a reason maybe so where I would like to try this sport I would really want to try it in the at the beach in the sea yeah but my friend told me one of my friend told me he he did his wind surfing at the lake in Wales just a random lake and the lake is kind of nasty some lakes there are there they forbidden peoples to to surf there or swim there so I think the beach the go to the beach is the best choice but the to be honest I think the the sea in Englands in the whole UK isn't that nice <laugh> because so so muddy and not clear at all and inside the sea many stones so I don't think it will be a good idea to it would be a good idea to surf there I would like to go some the sea in the mediterranean countries like Italy Spain I would like to go to beach there and maybe I can let my friends teach me how to surf but it I don't think literally I don't think it will be easy to learn that because I need to balance learn to balance on when when the wave come the strong wind I need to keep balance and also I need to coordinate well with my between my arms and legs which kind of hard
China_Band_6_108425	okay I would like to meet Taylor Swift because she's my favorite singer and I think she's more than just a singer right now we called it when we study her we study her because she's more like a phenomenon and she created a lot of records that no one has ever did before or in the future like in a prediction is like in twenty years no one will do the same thing as her or do something beyond her and she said I know all his all her like in records albums and gossips actually and I think I like to meet her because for me in my opinion she's really kind and she cares about the rise of the group of LGBT and also the group of the women just like a lot of female singers like that and yeah I think and also she she raise two cats and I'm a I'm a cat lover so yeah I like to meet the I like to meet her and also it's really a pity because I've never been to her concert because she doesn't come to China many times and she did a lot of concert in America or in the Europe but not in China and it's it's fine because in China we have a strict rule for singers to come in foreigner singers if you have your political opinion you may be not you will be rejected to come to China that is the feeling but still I hope she can come here and I will definitely go to her concert and I'll buy the first row I think that and also I like her gossip because all all the men she dated they're they are really handsome and famous
China_Band_6_108426	yes well I actually I haven't do so much travelling these days so I try hard to remember the very earliest years from the travelling thing I think the place I visit with my friend which make me happy is just one well I I've talked earlier about the island in southeast island in China called Sanya where my best friend who have a has a a son a very cute son and we travel together and we and my mother yeah I took my mother with me and yeah there are four of us that went to there and we of course we swimmed a lot and spend spent a lot of time at the beach and having had the sunshine shower yeah and we have a lot of seafood and when the kids went to bed we talked a lot chat and girls talk and watched movies from the television and it's my feeling
China_Band_6_108432	yes I want to describe you an advertisement I watch on the TV it's it's a non-commercial advertisement I think through the different kind of hype in the TV I think these non-commercial advertisement attract me a lot because its describe a thing happened at home when a mother came from work and the the boy know sees the tired face of his mother so he provide a basin of warm water for for his mother to wash his hand or face and he provides some food and and a bottle of milk I think I remembered and to his mother because he think his mother is very tired to support the family and I think these advertisement reminds me a lot to respect to your parents and because they they work very hard to support our family and we should comfort them and to reduce their stress and we should pay pay back their their their warm heart and I think we should do a lot of good things to our parents they are very hard and I I thinks after watching this non-commercial advertisement I learned to do some things when my parents get get get home when after a long day work so I think it impressed me a lot I want to describe this advertisement to you and and I think I think this kind of
China_Band_6_108435	sure and when I talking about the prize maybe I have I don't have so ambition to get a prize but if I had to say I would say the top ten of the score in my school it's a really common prize for any school this is a I think this is a reward to one's work if I really hard work for a things or for a subject I paid it a lot I paid it my time I paid it my my my effort so I really want to I really want to have a reward about my effort if I if I want to win it the the cost I paid is can not be very less and as much as possible that I paid maybe the possible that I can I can win this prize is more high so if I have a chance I really I'm really happy to get this prize okay the prize is have not so many meanings but it's a it witness witness my my efforts my hard work and that's all the prize do if I cannot win it the
China_Band_6_108438	yes well there was a time that I I and my family drove a car to the to one of my relative and that was a winter so the car was not so the car broke broke down just and after we found it we have about two miles away from our destination so we have to walk there because of because of the cold weather we and I and my family have to have to tolerate the cold weather so that's really horrible for me and my family yeah and after we reached our relative's home I and my family just caught some relative authorities to repair our car on the on the way so the the authority the author the authority just take our car to the industry or first or whatever they just repair it and after before we get our car it takes about one day so the time is one day after we reached the relative s home I was a little bit cough silent cause
China_Band_6_108460	okay my my grand father he was a farmer thirty years ago and and at that time lots of people in China tea to farmers and they just to do with the field and them crops and and when I was young I always go to my grand father's their house and their live helping to do that thing and and actually I I won't help too much but I just like to the time if you're into the the things I like to get along with my grandfather and and I I know that not too much but my grandfather tell me a lot of this a lot of this he tell me how to recognize the different plants of the recognized the the the things it this full for you to to eat and something you can't eat is to wait for another time you can eat it and and he did a lot you know after that period China has lot different had a change some people could do the commercial things and my grandparents and their family just have a grass roots style grocery and at that time I will help them either out too and I think this is more fun because you could do could deal lots of people there were lots of people we can know a lot of people and but I think the two jobs are both good cause the first job I think it is for us to a chance to to experience the beautiful nature and to to get along well
China_Band_6_108468	yeah that question it should remind me the that that broke down about two decades ago at that time I I was with my husband and at that time he was my boyfriend and we were planning to go for a sightseeing for a for a day just for a day and actually he is not a experienced driver at that time almost the first time we drove and we just let's see we are not sure what's going to happen during our journey but we we just look we just looked forward to it but while we were driving and my husband said that oh I I'm I felt a little bit nervous there's so many cars on the road and I am I driving too fast but actually when I see the meter and it just said two twenty miles it's not that fast and I I got I became a little bit nervous about that and then he actually and and he he said that be prepared that we may just hurt someone or or we may bump into the road but luckily that all none of them happened what happened is that the car just broke down it didn't work so I we we we just called the repair factory and they they came up a rescue truck or car I I don't know how to say that and then they they just tried to rescue us but unfortunately when when they put our car along the road the the rope just broke again and then so we have we had to just call another rescue car and then
China_Band_6_108485	the trip I would like to talk about is the trip that I went on with my university classmate during my freshman year in the university it was I remember it was it took like a whole summer vacation which means about two month long generally give or take maybe it was like sixty seven days I roughly yeah I don't remember the exact time anyway basically it's like this summer summer school type of thing that we had classes normally on weekdays many separate related to English literature and we would go sightseeing some weekends the school was actually situated in the Tristate area of United States so basically on weekdays we were in our campus on the state of New Jersey and on weekends we would travel to the city of New York to do some sightseeing and sometimes at night we would went to some shows on Broadways we actually went to abundant of Broadway shows I remember this particular show it was Chicago it was something that none of have actually be seened before but you know the overall the trip was was actually decent

China_Band_7_105733	I do really know a person who's very good at foreign language but I think my teacher is almost most of them are English teachers and I don't feel suprised by their good the mastering of this kind of language but one of my teachers that's Spanish teacher yes I took that course Espanol and the after third semesters when I get into the university and he uses the language almost every day because this is his job and I think he use this language for the the most important reason is that he he likes it him he use it because he teld us that he choose this major in when he was in the university cause he likes the Spanish literary so he he did this job and for the second reason's that they can earn as I think it is necessary so he use it in every day and just this is the reason and and the third third reason that what he use this language is for the research because he learned that studying the Latin America Latin America literary work it was a lot it this a lot in this so I was you know I I worship him I want to be I want to be a foreign teacher just like him when I'm after my studying in the major I like I said before the TESOL as I think this person I think okay I oh I I made this first last question describe how you think person let you speak this I think learning learning and mastering a language is something to at least two of the method one is
China_Band_7_105760	okay so I'm going to talk about my experiences in luxury coat store so last summer we last summer vacation my mother my mother and I went out to hit the stores and there was we went to the central area of Beijing we live in Beijing and there is a very you know it's a very there are lots of luxury retailers there retailers there and we went into the Burberry shop you know and maybe we dressed dressed some way we dressed like like the people who can't afford them so they they they treat me really really bad I just there is a windbreaker that looks very nice typical style of Burberry and I I I said I said can you please pass me one and I want to try it she doesn't the the you know the the the workers here the workers did he she just don't want to talk to me you know yeah maybe and actually I really couldn't afford to buy it but as a brand and as a employee I think it's her duty to do that to let me try them on right and I think I'm quite confused about that cause in China especially in the in the typical metropolis like Beijing I think it's a quite normal phenomenon when you dress when you dress very normal and you went into a went into a store some sometimes they they just don't want to serve you and I think this totally wrong I just couldn't accept that yeah I don't think maybe but what can I do with that I I think maybe next time I just need to dress better or I just don't go to that kind of stores
China_Band_7_105761	okay when its comes to this topic I'd like to share you with my experience it was last month I went out to university to go to a swim center with my best friend Lucy the reason why we have a a free day is that we have had finished all our paper for the subjects and we are very happy we need to we wanted to find some way to celebrate our free day and you know because we often spent lots of time sitting before the computer screen to finish our paper so we have some pain in our back because of the sedentary life style so we decided to go to the swimming center which is just in ten minutes walk from our campus because you know swimming is is a good ways of exercise to strengthen our body and can heal our back pain so my I went there with my friends you know actually I don't I didn't know how to swim swim but she told me it is it was very easy to float into the wind the water and after I acquired the skill I found it was a piece of cake for me to swim in a frog style and it was very happy this day we spend nearly four hours in the swimming pool and after that I found my back pain has released in some degree and after the play in the swimming center we we continued to
China_Band_7_105765	okay the food I like that people also eat in special events I would like to talk about fish we normally eat fish at Spring festivals there are plenty of reasons behind it fish in Chinese literature always means the sound is very similar to leftover so it it it illustrate an underlying expectation that the family will be abundant enough that that they can have leftovers in the next year so this is one reason and also fish is a food that is easily accessed by whole nation so I think it is reasonable that we eat fish at special events well fish in the dining table at spring gala is even more prevailing than dumplings actually because dumpling is more appealing to people in the north while fish is fish is prevalent all over China and the way people cook fish is boiling or they will fry the fish to me I prefer boiled because I think it remains the authentic flavor of the fish and I think when I eat fish it always the time that our family get together at some sort of reunion party or festivals so I think fish attached with some special some special mood and record with my family and relative
China_Band_7_106001	well sorry about two years ago my my my best friend failed her first college examination and she felt very disappointed and frustrated and I spent a long time comforting her I at last she was committed admitted by a not very well known college in China and when when she got into that university she felt very sad and unhappy so she got she decided got back to high school to study again to prepare for the college entrance examination I I I told her no matter what you decide decide I will support you all the time and she got back to the high school to study all the time and I communicated with her with Q we we-chat and I supported her all the time I told her you will you have to believe yourself and she said she told me not to worry about her she will she would be successful in the next college entrance examination and time flies last she did very well in the second college entrance examination she got a very high score and I felt very proud of her because I believed her she would what she want to do and at last she was accepted by a renown university in China and she studied a major as well like just like me if from the bottom of my heart as her best friend I felt very proud of her success because you know college entrance exam is very important for Chinese student
China_Band_7_106054	sure so thinking about unusual holiday at one time I think you know Dragon Boat festival and on that festival we have three days off so I went to the woods with my friend together at that day we well we wanted to go on that day so we prepared some like sandwiches sausages and fruit and drinks that we wanted and we went there it was really huge roots and we really enjoyed beautiful scenery over there however after we cooked our sausage and put that into our sandwiches and then while we are eating we were eating at that time it rained really heavily so it was the first time that I had picnic that it rained because I didn't go to picnic for a lot of times and it rained so that's so we hold up our umbrella held up umbrella and then eat sandwich like this this this that was really an interesting experience that I had hadn't experienced before so I I think that's very unusual and later after the rain stopped we went for a hiking like into the woods so and we took a lot of pictures with big smile and we were very happy that day so what made it unusual is that friends we could talk together and enjoy the heavy rain yeah that's all thank you
China_Band_7_106106	okay so basically the historical building I really want to see and you know learn more about is definitely the Westminster Cathedral in London which is it just looks like huge giant church they just have comparatively bigger size than the normal one and yeah absolutely this building is currently using for some national celebrations such as like the British Queen and when him when she meets some very important people from international environments they will they will simply celebration there and also maybe sometimes there is a national Christianity day or they just doing some celebrations in London also there is another called the remembering day where we have to start remember about these people who died in the first and second wars we normally remembering their death and yeah sacrifice for the United Kingdom so that is what they're currently doing now but I really want to learn about how does this building has been built because I been learn the architecture design for a Ge session course but I was really interested in for many times for for a long period and I try to learn how does the you know the from hundred years ago how people have technologies to build that sort of you know spectacular building especially the top part is so complicated even the recent years there are so many country has the same technology level could they able to build this kind building so that's shows the British people's intelligence and their very strong mind and very creative mind as well because I've never seen that kind of building in China or in other Asian Asian countries obviously and also I really want to study the history of this building what is this building built for as original intention
China_Band_7_106121	okay I'd like to know more about a period in history when it was called three kingdoms it's a period of history in China and well there are three kingdoms and the main reason I want to know more about it because there was this man who was the prime minister kind of prime minister in one of the kingdom I admire him a lot because he was a a a fierce and powerful man who who was also extremely smart well what he did was basically he overthrew a former former king and supported a puppet king so he was like the number one figure of this kingdom so very powerful well I I learned some well the reason why I learn I want to learn more about this period is because you know there are many TV series movies about this period that characterize him as a villian but for me he he's not that kind of person so whenever I watch movies or TV series with my friends my family member I always like to ask what they think of this this hero and if and they have some opposite opinions with me I like to discuss sometimes even argue with them so I want to learn more about this period also because I want to know what really happened during that period and not only from TV series I want to read books about this period just to tell if
China_Band_7_111584	oh yes well the person I invited is one of my good friends and they can call me you can call him Bear and and a few others because why I invited him was because I just graduated from grade two of middle school and and because of they because we we have to separate again into some new classes in grade three so it would be little time that we will see again next year and I'm not gonna not see him next term so after a formal meal we we ate and he actually is a a really good friend of mine actually the first friend I made when I comed into middle school and also we can do some activities after the meal so we went to this place called Xidan it's up in Beijing and and it was on Saturday the just on Friday just after the graduation ceremony in my school and this kind of bit short silent well my friends felt maybe sad or a bit tired maybe on this meal because we will separate and some of them will go away to difference different provinces and
China_Band_7_111607	okay just a couple of days ago I had dinner with my family members and when I when we just went into a restaurant and we sit and the waitress just give us an order but after about half an hour our dishes don't serve and we just call the waitress why and she came over here and just tell us sorry she didn't tell the didn't tell the cook about the order and at that moment I really freak out because I think it's unbelievable because we just ordered and then I just felt there's some sad look on that a young waitress face so instead of complaining to the manager I just asked asked this young girl what happened and she told me some sad news about herself and at that moment I think maybe that's a bad service for us for our whole family to enjoy this beautiful meal but for her that's a bigger news some sadder news so just I think I should choose to forgive this girl so I just cannot enjoy a very expected meal but at that moment I think I did something very good cause sometimes people just run something unfortunate and if we can just take their shoes may can we can understand their situation if especially some bad situation so that's also a bad thing that I experienced but also a very useful experience
China_Band_7_111608	kay so I will talk about an experience that once I found a lost cell phone so cell phone is I was actually far from where I lived it's actually find near my apartment where like you know all kinds of people played and enjoy themselves so so since it's in the apartment it was found like specifically it's found behind a air conditioner so the air conditioner is actually out of use for a long time but you know I was a little child at the time and me and my friends enjoyed playing around there so it's kind of a coincidentially we found that phone and so things after are actually quite simple so with the phone first thing you you do would be open that and we press the open button but no response unfortunately so we did not have the chance to guess whether it belongs to a boy or a girl but that doesn't matter and what we finally dealt with that phone is that we contact our parents since we're just little children at that time and actually my friend's parents took us to the nearest police station and we asked for a few help from the police men and we then hand it over but actually we've like privately speaking that's what our parents do not know is that we actually found house through the people near where it's found so we actually asked for a few people did they recognize the phone but unfortunately the answer's no so we at last in the end we hand it over to the policemen and the things afterward are actually out of our control since we're children and we like the friend's parents leave their telephone number and and I don't know this
China_Band_7_111609	The handsome person I would like to tell you about is Jeff I met him when I was studying New Zealand and he's a friend of mine I met when I was visiting Hamilton and I think he's handsome because he is not only a gentle English British gentle Englishman but also he has a young heart and he has a really positive attitude towards his life he loves to read and watching movies and also he read he's a big fan of the West electronic devices such as laptops tablets and cell phones that surprised me a lot because he was way older than me but he likes the newest things on the in the market and sometimes he jokes about how bad he's at cook and how good I was at cooking because I was a chef however he he he he will just he will however he will just joke about how good I was and also the most interesting about him is that he he lives alone but he never feels alone and he enjoy being him being himself and he could just enjoy a nice afternoon resting at home reading under a really nice sunlight while he plays the the really funny music like pop songs as background music
China_Band_7_111619	okay I'm going to talk about a place I visited with my friends about half a year ago and actually the place is actually a province located in northwestern China the name of the province is Qinghai province and I went to that province with my several of my high school best friends after we finish high school entrance examination and and the province is really beautiful with a wide variety of different land land forms for example the plateau for example the canyons and we did a lot of great things there for example on the first five days of our visit to the province we went on a car journey in the plateau we visited snow mountains and so on and on the last five days of our journey we went to visit a canyon where we go parachuting and on the last day I remember we went to the desert and had a really good camel tour and as for why I had a good time there and the first reason maybe it is it can be reguarded as my graduation journey and we went on that journey without any concerns and and without being stressful because already finish our most important exam maybe in our life and the second time is I had some really fresh new experiences there in the province as as I mentioned I went parachuting I went on a camel tour and so on and the third reason is the friends were my best friends at at high school and during the journey and whenever we had some misunderstanding we would always sit down and talk to settle the problems together so during the journey during the visit we didn't have any kind of conflict and that's the reason why I have good time there oh sorry and another reason maybe and during our visit at the province we visited
China_Band_7_111757	the person I really want to be similar is my best friend and she's a really a nice person I met her in my primary school the first day of my primary school so I knew her for very long time and she lived above me she live in twenty-second floor and I live in nineteenth floor she's really interesting person she has a lot of interesting ideas and she's been quite creative there was once we have this we play we often play roller skating after school and she's always the one encourage me because I'm really bad at sport I'm not sporty at all I played roller skating with my roller skating was rubbish and I was rolling really really slow and she's really fast and she can also do lots of techniques like jumping from the stairs or jumping all around and stuff like that and she encouraged me to roller skating down the slope with her and it was really fun and without her I couldn't be able to do it and she's also a really funny person she always told me jokes about my classmate or the book I read about and we also did a oil painting together and it was quite fun because both of us are quite arty artistic and she want to be a architecture when she grow up and she's also a really nice person she never jealous about anyone her friend she always want her friend to be the best version of themself they it's quite rare among the girls especially at that age like girls are jealous with each other
China_Band_7_111778	oh yeah so like I know many people who can speak really well foreign languages but the first one came to mind is actually my boyfriend and he's Gene his name is Gene and he's actually Korean and we met last year when I was like last year I went to Australia for exchange for one term and we met there and he can speak like he's Korean but he can speak both Chinese and English and Korean that's because he's born and raised in Shanghai in China like her his parents work in Shanghai and like I think I think he spend more than half of his life in Shanghai so of course he speak Chinese like native speaker and how often he's I think almost every day at least in between our communication but like you know we met in Australia so we use English as our language for study and work for just social things that stuffs but between our communication we use Chinese more and what oh yes just for for daily life cause like he has many Chinese friends and people who speak English as well and them will like I think the language environment is very important for you to learn the language so of course he's born and raised in not born just raised up in China so and that's one thing and another thing is like you have to like make make friends here like I can I can be a Chinese who only speak Chinese and a little English and I can survive myself in an English speaking country but if you have like you have to socialize with people you have to make friends and share your ideas and like work out together
China_Band_7_114590	actually I have I rarely went to historical places in the past and if I have to give you an answer about this question I guess it would be the Palace Museum it is also known as purple Forbidden City and it is located in the prime area of Beijing where garment and the very large shopping malls are just on its doorstep it is initially constructed in Ming Dynasty about which is about sixty six hundred years ago it is initially used as the house for the royal family and and few about one one hundred years ago the there there there was an a revolution and the government took over the place so it became unoccupied for about three three years but now they the government nationalizes revolutinizes and has been a place to for art art exhibition or performances both both for Chinese visual and foreign goods the building itself is has the color of yellow and brick red which symbolizes wealthiness in ancient China
China_Band_7_114593	okay so this person I'm going to talk about is called Rita she is my classmate and my friend she's really good at English and Japanese and Chinese and I think she learned these she she's definitely learned Chinese first because her parents both of her parents are Chinese and it's kind of her native language but I think after that she learned English and Japanese at the same time because she went to Japanese school and international school I think she use these three languages pretty often because she communicated with us in in English while she communicates with her family in Chinese and she communicate with her Japanese friend in Japanese of course I think it's really a piece of cake for her and she just really she's a master of all these three languages and that that's very impressive I think she it's definitely comes from her very hard working practices and because you know she's I'm aware she's personally very hard working person she's she has very good academic achievement so I think she doesn't practice a lot and also another reason is I think this the environment she has because both of her parents are Chinese and she has all these Japanese friends and she has us like she can talk she can speaks in English to so I think it's very helpful to her to maintain her fluency in all these three languages like she wouldn't just forget you know one day and it's impossible for her to lose this ability to learn to speak this language and I don't think this her language skills can be transferred to other things
China_Band_7_114668	I would like to talk about a time that I visit the water park with my family just last week me and my family visit the water park together and there a lot of equipment to do exercise in that park you know after a whole week for studying and working all of us get in tired and exhausted and we want some time to relax ourselves so we choose the water park because the park is not far from the far from the home that we live so we can you know just walk there or you you know the right there now just taking the subway or busses so it's very very convenient for us to get there for the exercise you know we we do some stretches you know it's very relaxing and the reason the reason why we we choose the park visit is that we want some quality time that me and my family spend together you know during the weekdays although we get together but you know we you know I would say never connect with each other at a emotional level but you know as a family we need that we need that time and to connect at emotional level talk about the funny things happen on during the weekdays and you know and we also have a picnic in that water park we bring some sandwiches and some drinks after having fun for the whole morning we had a we together had a lunch there I would I would hope we can have the more time like this in the future that's all
China_Band_8_000134	huh I'd like to share a party with you which happened several days ago it was for my one of my besties she was my one of my best friends actually she was striving to pass her IELTS exam with high band and she works very hard we hold we held this party and I I designed the whole party it was held in an ornate and exquisite cafe I give her a present which was bought in Bali it was a intricate and impressive and unique handmade stitching I give it to her because I I as a memento because I because I wanted to remind her of our time and the party's ambience was was very happy was very exciting but a little bit sentimental because she was leaving and she she her destination it was Britain but my destination was Australia so we actually we
China_Band_8_000319	okay so the last time somebody gave me money as a gift was my aunt I visited my mother's hometown and it was my mother's sister I haven't been there for almost ten years so it's a long time since I could really see her in person I feel it is out of the joy that we got to reunite together that she gave me money I used the money to buy shoes because I I wanted to do a jogging I wanted to build a healthy lifestyle so I picked up jogging so I wanted to buy some new shoes that would really fit in this goal and also I brought some I bought a charger for my laptop because my last charger kind of got broke when you attach the charger to the laptop the the little light wouldn't really blink on so I thought I may change the charger for my laptop and also how did I feel about receiving the money I have mixed feelings about receiving money on one way of course I I like receiving money it gives me chance to buy more more things for myself on the other hand I feel I'm adult now I'm responsible for earning my own money it's kind of like ambivalence in myself thinking like should I really take this money or not only there they've fixed point me is the Chinese tradition like receiving it is more polite and better than just rejecting it I feel and also in that visit not only this one aunt give me money also my grand grand mother and grandfather they both give me money the the amount is not huge but it's still like one fifth of a monthly salary if you had to say and there's okay
China_Band_8_000360	so when I was around ten my therapist was called Lucy she gave me a book which was named Girl, Interrupted I guess that the reason really liked the book was because explored a side to mental health that isn't necessarily explored in a nowaday society but in social media or the film industry or you know just people in a society I think have really open up my open my eyes and it was a very original and also down to earth book which explored the main characters experience with mental illness it explored an personality disorder and her experience in a mental hospital the mental security unit she was in at the time when she was in Fairmont America okay so the main character is called Sandra Cason and she was eighteen years old when she admitted to the mental institution straight after attempted suicide so I think it was a harrowing account a true account of what had she what she had done to get herself into that dark place I really do sympathize with her and all the things she had to go through to be able to recover and you know embark on a road to recovery the reason I like the book is because I think I it was something I could relate to and also you know confide in cause I saw her as this character who I could confide in and tell my all my sorrow sorrows and worries to
China_Band_8_002157	so I wanted to study abroad before I have a master's now already so I'm twenty six twenty six twenty seven now so I wanted to study abroad when I was in college and my father wanted me to do that so that but I didn't really have enough time and why I I wanted to do this because you know I I was an English major and when I was a kid I always enjoyed talking speaking English I always enjoyed learning English so I always wanted to go abroad and you know see the world and enjoy the culture and you know study and get something that's my own like some my own expertise so why that's why I wanted to do it and why I didn't have time enough time is because my the first year of my college year in life my my dad kind of offered me like if you there's some good programs in your in your university you can go but just check it out first so I went back to school and check it out and I was like maybe I should give this a give this a go because this is what I wanted the whole time but so the the the not enough time part is my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer so I think that for that whole year I didn't really have time to think about my future at all I was just kind of wallowed in the the grief that my father is is heavily ill so I think that's why I said that that I didn't have enough time or also I didn't really I was not supported in a way because my father was ill and I didn't want to burden him much more so that's that's why I said I didn't have enough time but I now that I have enough time so that's why I'm taking the IELTS and I want to go you know kind of like to pursue my my the dream that I have had before so yeah yeah
China_Band_8_002353	sure okay the type of food that I I'm going to talk about is called tang yuan it's a type of Chinese traditional Chinese food it's quite like well let's describe it so it's basically looks like a ball and it has a like a I mean silent like it has two it has one layer I mean a membrane like thing outside the stuffing yeah the membrane like thing is made of rice people's crush the rice and and I think they boil it and use the use the kind of like product to make a slide of of the membrane and I will usually fill it with I mean we usually we can fill it with anything but we usually fill it with kind of bean crushes beans crushes yeah and we made it into a bowl like thing and and we boil it we yeah the the kind of like it's kind of like it's kind of like dumplings but the outside membrane's made of rice rather than wheat or something yeah huh why people eat it at special events because it's a bowl like shape so I mean the bowl like in in Chinese means harmony yeah so it it is it gives you kind of good wishes for people who for people who eat it in the special event
China_Band_8_004016	okay I'd like to talk about a very important decision I made under the help of my brother it was time when I graduated from my middle school it was the it's the same international I currently been studying in it's name called Metro International School and after I graduated from the middle school I had to decide whether I want to go to Japan to study or I I I should go to the some western the western world to study the reason why I want to go to Japan to study is because I I know language I know how to speak Japanese and I and both my parents they know how to speak Japanese as well and last time when I when I travelled to Japan I really loved people the people there and I also love the animation Japanese animation and that's why I really want to know more about Japan and really want to stay in Japan in in in no matter how no matter high school or university but the reason why I I couldn't decide between Japan and western world's because cause I was studying in this school in this international school I I also love the western world and I love Canada I love America and it's much easier for me to just be a part of that society but my mother help me to to to do the decision because she has been working in big Japanese company for a long time and she know like how Japanese people like deal with something that's very important and she told me that it's I
China_Band_8_012432	yes I would like to talk about the promotion I got about two month ago it was given by my boss and because I was working I'm working for the current employer for like three years and I think it's time for him to give me a promotion so right now I'm an investment manager instead of a instead of assistant so I think it's not just about the paycheck it's more about you know someone really approved you are prove your ability to work your expertise that's very important in my career I mean to me and also if you go for example if I go go and meet client and when I handed him my business card and when they say the when they see the title is assistant they don't really they didn't really take you seriously so I really need this I really need this promotion to so that you know I can flash my card and telling them that look that I'm I'm a manager so we can talk about some real business and yeah I really appreciate that he gave me this promotion it means a lot to me three years hard work finally paid off is that too quick
China_Band_8_030318	yeah I would like to talk about a party I had when I was in America for an internship in summer and that was a party held by my Jamaican host family and that was very interesting for me because I would really I really enjoyed that intercultural communication because a lot of people there really believed in me although I was a total stranger for them and they asked me a lot of questions about China about myself and that made feel make me feel like I was one of their family members and secondly I think the most important thing for I for me to enjoy that party is because they showed me a totally different lifestyle for you know foreigners and I talked with a bunch of old guys and they told me they didn't have a wife they had girlfriend and they actually lived very romantic life in which I you know kind of envy because in my own country old people don't really live like that so by that intercultural communication I can feel some clashes and conflicts however more importantly I can feel you know the bigger picture of harmony because they can tell me how they live differently and I can understand them you know through a perspective where I come from a different civilization and I can really get to feel them feel their life so I think that was you know the best example of best example of intercultural communication by partying all the people are relaxed and happy so I think this is the reason why I really enjoyed that party in Jamaica no America held held by Jamaican family yeah is this too soon okay by the way I think also the most important thing for me because in that party I had to use English to express all my feelings and ideas and that was a very difficult task for that time because I wasn't really fluent in English back then so that party really you know opened my mind and helped me to get you know more information from foreigners independently and I can use my language skills and I think I practiced my language skills so that was a process both entertaining and informative so I think based on all the three reasons above I think that was the party I enjoyed the most so that's it yeah
China_Band_8_031497	okay to the place I would really love to visit would be to the North Pole or the South Pole and the how I would travel to this place I haven't really done my research I guess I would I'd get a flight and then be on a on a big boat to get to this place and I would just relax and watch the scenery in this place without really doing that much I would travel with a a group of friends and I would say that we can watch penguins in the south pole and then polar bears in north pole the reason I would really love to visit these two places are I think they're the last place on earth that really clean and untouched by the human species everything would remain what they were like thousands of years ago so they're not polluted they're they're they're clean and they have really a a variety a big range of wild animals to to watch and I would think that it would give me a really good time to be away from work from the hassles in life and just to relax and and do nothing and think about nothing and I would love to I would love to combine this with kind of a spiritual tour as well cause I've seen places I I've seen ads where they can combine a spiritual journey with this kind of tour where you travel with a lot of psychologists and on this tours they can give you like personal sessions to talk about how you feel what you look for in life and in that kind of place its it just really give you time to be blank for a while and when you are blank sometimes the subconscious emerges that you can really get to know who you are and what you want to do in your with your life and I think that would be a really precious experience for me
China_Band_8_032332	okay okay so the language that I would like to start learning is French yeah so there are several reasons I want to learn this language or this there are several reasons why I have a particular interest in this language so the first one is because my of my family background because my grandfather was a French professor at a various prestigious university the Nanjing University so he graduated from the university in the nineteen fifties and then he started teaching the French language and also French culture at that university until the time he retired so when I was very young so he started to to teach me some very basic basic expressions in French like self introduction something like that and so the second reason is that because my best my favorite singer is Celine Dion so he is a French he's actually a French he's a French Canadian who was born in Quebec in Canada so her most of her sounds are in either English or French but I think I still feel that when you listen to her French sounds you feel that you are closer to her heart so I just feel that I just want to to to understand what she thinks in her French sounds so that's view the second reason and the third reason is because of my personal studying experience yeah because I graduated from the Beijing Foreign Studies University and I majored in the language of Czechoslovakia so I always feel that I have a fondness for any language expecially a language that is spoken in many different countries and those countries are not very close to China so I just feel that I I just like that kind of exotic feeling and also I think it helps me with my English yeah because you know there are a lot of similarities between different languages so actually I think although those languages are different in terms of their grammar or pronunciation or expressions but I think in terms of the demands that you you use in learning them I think it's quite similar so I think they are like interconnected so there are so I think there are several methods that I can employs in order to learn a language and first one is to find a a
China_Band_8_036909	okay actually today I'm going to talk about a person who I met like two years ago when I worked in the J.W. Marriott hotel and the Ritz Carleton hotel his name is Ram Ho and he his family name is Ho and his given name is Ram R A M Ram well actually he was grown up in Britain and he was the training manager and also the supervisor when I worked as an intern in that office so I when I first encounter I I felt a little bit nervous but his first impression give me a very kind give me a very kind of expression make me soon calm down well when I first encounter him I was attracted by his temperment because I think he's very gentle very very gentle like like the some old saying that goes in England just like that kind of gentleman so yes so so I have a very good impression on him first time and he has a very like deep eyes just like Chris Helmsworth it's it's really handsome and he usually go went to the gym so he's very fit as well and also he has a tiny face and I think is kind of like kind of like a model just so yeah so actually I was attracted first by his appearance and then I get to know when I got to know him I knew that something really interesting about him is that he has lots of hobbies such as he's usually using some of the cutting edge gadgets and he's very fashion actually because I think the normal image of a the stereotype of image of an training manager is that maybe he is so serious and he just focus on the work but actually he has variety of hobbies like focus on fashion and he also likes playing football when around him on the playground that was really cool yeah he cool it he's the captain he he was the captain of the team as well and when I worked with him actually he helped me a lot he and
China_Band_8_037174	yeah and really interesting old person I've met is my math teacher this semester and his full name is Alan Robinson but as a student I call him Mr. Robinson and how I met him he's my math teacher I see him every day and he is just really really funny he tells jokes all the time but because most of my classmates are not that good at English I'm really often the only one who gets the joke and laughs so I think he likes me a lot so sometimes after class ended he would tell me to come over and we would talk about our lives that really I think he he likes me a lot because I'm the only one who can like communicate with him as a student because most students in our school is there are other foreign teachers but student wise I'm like the one of the few students who can communicate him without too much trouble but despite his funniness he still has high expectation from my behaviors like although he tells jokes all the time and he's he keeps the environment of the class really easy but he does not allow any like bad behaviors so he still has a lot of basic expectations for how you should behave one thing that he says a lot is I'll keep things easy with you guys if you guys keep things easy for me and I really agree with that so I would I'd really behave myself in his class and sometimes I would go too far joke wise like I would talk to my friend a bit too loud or I would start scrolling on my phone and then I would get in some trouble but even though I've done that quite a few times he's still really kind to me and he forgave me many many times and well I would try to behave in his class cause I really really like him he's really really interesting I'm kind of sad that this semester's already halfway through
China_Band_8_111595	one of the advertisements that I remember most clearly is an adoption site advertisement I saw a few years ago it was an adoption site for cats and dogs and abandoned pets the main reason for this advertisment being one of the most clearly memorized for me is because I've always been an animal person and I've always had a soft spot for puppies and cats in need of help and similar situations like that in this advertisement they played footage from recording cameras they placed on stray animals and it it displayed how tough and how hard it was for the animals to get around and find food and water and shelter during the spanse of one day and in the footage you could see how certain people tried to violently treat these animals and sometimes that they came very close to death with traffic and with poisoned food and even in certain footages the animals actually died in the end and it made a very significant impact on my memory one things for sure because you know and seeing so many animals suffer it made me realize that I could contribute to help certain animals that were in need of help and this advertisement was the main cause for my adoption of a stray cat that I had taken in shortly after seeing this advertisement and well the advertisement was played on television for about two weeks I've seen it
China_Band_8_111638	okay well that'd be the time my little sister made me laugh you know in China many parents you know tell their kids if you do something bad or unwanted by the by by by us by our parents you'll be captured by the policeman so my sister was little my parents just my mother just tell her my mother just tells her if you keep doing something wrong the police will get you and there was one time my family went on a trip to someplace I can't really remember right now though it was on the highway though so my family was in the car and the car was driving right and he stopped at some service place I can't remember the name of it and I just kept bothering my little sister I kept you know annoying her just she is she was just a little kid and I just I just kept making fun of her and suddenly there's a a cop just came by and asked for my dad's registration and license license or something driver's license yeah he suddenly my little sister just came out with hey police man do you want my brother cause she he just kept annoying me and I was shocked by that little cause you know parents just always tell little kids to you know you do something bad the police will get you and that time my sister just suddenly he he comes out of nowhere and just she just said the police if you if you want my brother just take him away I was just really surprised and and that really made my family and I laugh I laugh so that was pretty interesting and that was a pretty memorable time that I experienced so even now my sister has grown up so much every time we just my family and I just talk about the the the stuff we did it just often makes me laugh so it's pretty you know precious memory
China_Band_8_114426	okay well this topic reminds me about an experience that I had last May at that time I joined an organization which aims to protect animals on the verge of extinction so I joined one activity and I went to particular areas in China to protect different kinds of animals like pandas in Sichuan province and migratory birds in Tianjin after we I learned a lot of information about animals the supervisor of that activity asked every member each new member to write a paper about what we learned and we need to finish that paper within two weeks and I after I finished it in June I believed that my work is terrific and it may have it it may have award an award and even though I believed that I should be awarded when the when the when my dreams comes true when my dream came true I was really surprised and I told the good news to my supervisor immediately she was also in a good mood and we talked about that we are going to have a dinner together to celebrate it I invited her to a restaurant near my home because the I I like the taste and most of the dishes and of this restaurant and I believed that she would be happy as well my supervisor she was strict with the paper and whenever she found a problem about my paper she will always call me immediately and we would figure out a solution to solve the problem successfully as we were having the as we were having the dinner together we also talked about the paper and and and we share our experiences and opinions about why this paper would be awarded and distinguished after the dinner we also talked and shared some that we had recently and later we went to a golf course to

India_Band_7_382839	the thing that I bought which I do not use anymore is a bicycle I bought it in two thousand fifteen because I bought it in only from only I bought it because my parents and my friends used to tell me that I'm getting fat day by day so I had to do something about it and the best thing I could do was because I cannot take out time for exercising so what I planned was that I will take bicycle to my work daily and so I went to market and bought bicycle in March of two thousand fifteen but actually I could not use it on regular basis because first of all it is very hard to get into this kind of habits and you just cannot start spending thirty to forty minutes of cycling since the day you the day you buy it so you have to develop a rhythm for it so I was I was not able to do that so initially I had a I had some problems I I because I I used to take car to my office daily so from coming from car to a bicycle was a huge I mean huge thing for me so I didn't do it do it persistently but later on I started going on bicycle it was okay for few months but then my company sent me for five months training to Hyderabad so the connection lost I couldn't cycle daily so when I came back from Hyderabad and I didn't feel like I will like to go on bicycle again so I just put it in my storeroom and it is lying there only since the day I I put it there so that's much of it but yeah I would I I daily think about taking it out and giving a ride on for ten minutes even but I've become lethargic I guess so I do not go for it and more importantly I work some other exercises equipment with me now which can work to reduce my fat instead of using this bicycle so I prefer those equipment like I I do boxing now and practice
India_Band_7_382840	well there are many situations and we have to face in our life when we have to get the task accomplished in no time or we are given very limited time for that I would like to describe here a time when that was in year two thousand twelve I faced and I had applied for a conference and Boston and I was accepted for that conference it was a group of eight to ten people we were in college and we had to rush there for our visas for the United States and we had very less time for applying to visas and to make our bookings and to reach for the conference but however we did not lose hope and we applied for the visa and in no time we were granted visa and now the next step was we had to make the bookings for our hotels so that we could have a stay there we could have some gathered some information about the things like how the cab system works there and everything so we didn't had enough time it was hardly less than a week's time when we had to book our flight tickets it was a very traumatizing experience as the flight was not at cheap rates when you book a flight a week before we you get you have to book that at an expensive price so that was an experience when I wanted to do that but eventually everything turned out to be very good and I was made my I was able to book my flight in time I was able to book my hotel in time however I did not get the same room for it as my friends did I had to stay alone but I was lucky that I could manage my booking and I was very happy that I managed to do everything in time I was able to visit the university the Harvard university in Boston it was a very memorable experience as it was one of my dreams to visit the university once in my lifetime so
India_Band_7_382844	so I'll I'd like to talk about Chinese food this kind of food is generally what we eat during special events it's not something that we generally eat during our our daytime or or generally in our Punjabi households so it's more like the the its generally during the weddings or or some special parties or events that is where we we can consume this kind of food why why people eat this at special events is because it's not too easy to prepare especially for our our households because it's not like Indian food is known to to be filled with spices and all however Chinese food has a completely different taste and the spices and all are are pretty moderate like it only if some Indian guy prepares it they tend to mix some flavors but if you go for authentic Chinese food it's pretty moderate in flavors and like you talk about noodles so you'd have noodles or when you talk about chops suey or fried rice if you if you have it at a authentic Chinese restaurant or or if it is prepared by some good chef it is pretty different tasting food and how people prepare this food is is is generally it's hand-cooked only there are pretty small vessels in which this kind of food is prepared the they use vinegar soy sauce and chili sauce and all it's it's nowhere near to to the cool spices that we use in our other foods so it's prepared using some special sauces and some vinegar and all of this and as for why I like this kind of food is because like here you get accustomed to what you eat daily so a change is anyways welcome every whenever it comes really so I do like it occasionally only but in general I would tend to stick to

India_Band_7_382849	there are many incidents I have faced in my in my life that I have to I have to you know I had a bad experiences with with with in in the restaurants and the shops and many service centers so one that I recall is when I when my phone was not working properly and I give it to the to the company service center so at first when I arrived there I had to wait for for like two hours there and after that they examined my phone and they said it will take around a week to to to fix the problem the problem was that it it it has some issues in the processor part of the phone so I understand that it it takes time to fix those problems because my background is engineering so it it was the customer representative who was not responding to my queries after when I submitted my phone there and it it takes around two months to get it back from get to to get it to like to to get back to them and it made me very angry that it it is there there is no alternative provided to me to during that period and I have to arrange the phone from my one of my friend and the the main part which was wrong about those their service was they were as I said they were not responding to the queries and their manager also was very careless about these these complaints so so finally I reached out to the region
India_Band_7_382852	during my childhood in school we studied many subjects one of the subject which I didn't enjoy studying was history as history never fascinated me and it was kind of a boring subject for the whole class we have to remember a lot of dates and that and you have to remember a lot of names and always in my exam I used to just clear on passing marks I never got an excellent marks in that I have studied that subject for more than six to seven years as it was compulsory for us to take a history class and the class was always taken by miss Saha and she made it though entertainment but we never ever enjoyed reading that subject there were the stories of many many historical prince and princesses of India in that but it to my but nowadays I enjoy that subject a lot I thought I should enjoy that subject my recent trip to Jaipur I visited many palaces and in that in my history class we used to read about that palaces and the princes and who who conquered that palace which empire was there that time so I thought now the subject is very interested and when we go to the palaces I read about the history of that we read that how the Mogul empire how the other empire was there and they did so much for us how their culture was how they used to live how they used to dress up there's been a lot of display now which we used to read in history books back at that time but it's very good to see now that the history class that was boring now it seemed being interested we clicked pictures of that historical places we visit now and we put it on the various social network sites which is a very interesting thing as people do ask where is this where have you visited how how was the background at that time so it it's it's like the subject always now interest I think nowadays

India_Band_8_379854	the most important decision of my life for everyone's life it's their wedding so it was very big decision for me to take I had many questions in my mind it was last year that happened so I was very confused about the decision and the person if I should get married the questions I had in my mind were if it is the right age to get married or will the person think of me as you my parents think of me and respect me and love me the priorities if they will change with the time after getting married and am I self ready to take the responsibility for the person and the other family I was very confused and there was a great dilemma of what decision to be taken so my brother he's very he's four years younger to me but he's much more intelligent so he sat me down and we talked for about two or three hours the one thing he made me very much clear is you cannot decide over one person until you meet the one the person he will marry someone she'll the she'll think the same question but as you know that I am a right person she'll not understand until she meets me the same way you never know about the other person until you meet him yourself so he said if you meet him and you think he respects you he'll always keep your priorities at the first second responsibilities come along with the time it's not that the first day you'll go you'll take all responsibilities and they will throw all the responsibility on you and you'll have to ace them all like a daughter you had to learn over the time and you knew how to do everything and as a daughter-in-law also you will learn it over the time and with time you'll learn to grow and be a better from daughter-in-law to a daughter so it was a big decision and I I asked him what should I do and he sat he fixed a meeting with the guy and I as I talked to the guy when he was sitting along with me and his decision actually was right
India_Band_8_379858	I usually like to watch drama movies but many times when I have in serious mood I like to watch comedy movies to laugh a bit one movie which left a lasting impression on me was All The Best it's a Hindi movie Bollywood movie directed by Rohit Shetty it's about two friends and their comical situation because they want more money and they're not very rich so they are trying to fool their brother into giving them more money so there are some side characters which are so well presented in the movie that they make you laugh more than the main characters the situational comedy is at its best in this movie because the situations created are like they make you laugh without any dialogues or even without any without saying something you just laugh by watching them and there are not many songs in the movie which keeps it pace fast and I don't even like to watch many songs in the movie the thing which made me laugh most was the side character's role who were so funny that he made you laugh even with with looking at his face you did not even hear his dialogues and I remember this movie most because at that time I was in my college and so we used to get little time to watch as we were studying law so there were many subjects we had to study well so whatever time we used to get we always used to watch this movie again and again with my friends and we discussed this movie so much that we even remembered the dialogues and we used to create situations within ourselves like some of my friends may become the brother and some of my friends

KSA_Band_6_35319	yeah sure I'll speak about one of these parts that I really prefer doing in most of the days first of all basketball is one of my favorite that I would like to learn to know more about it and because I love seeing some scenes and some other players that plays basketball and I feel that it's very enjoyable to know how the balls are dribbling and how they throw it and how they enjoy it so I believe it's very nice and it's it gives a sense of feeling that you can do the best and you can reach and and it's a group work so it's something very nice I'll prefer to do this and try it in UA in my country because I want to give the benefits for my country I don't want to go to other countries to just send my information maybe I'll be a proficient so to learn this one and thirdly I want to learn this part although it would be difficult for me at the beginning because beginning is always difficult so I'll just try to work hard work on myself part by part and then I'll be proficient in the future because the first at first the the works are really difficult but lastly it will be easy I chose this topic I mean the basketball is because I love basketball I love seeing the basketball people who recommend to do many things and I believe that they are very fascinated and very nice and in addition to that I believe that doing something that will benefit our country is very good in a good way and in a good manner would help it so much and in addition to that as well I would like to include that my country nowadays like Dubai and Sheik Muhammed the highness Sheik Muhammed en rashid al maktoun he's referring to sports mostly and he want people to be proficient in sports so I need also to improve my sports so I can benefit my country in the future or maybe now
KSA_Band_6_35328	sure maybe around twenty year ago I found a lost driving license near to a building under construction and that building was belongs to my father so I was daily going around this building morning maybe nighttime to check what has what are the differences and what did the neighbors did with this with the building and that night I found maybe late night as well I found a driving license belongs to a woman a strange woman definitely I am want know her and I found it around the building and I took it to police station at the same time because I was worrying if she missed it by the wrong or something happened to this lady and that's why her ID was missing around the building at night or at at late time and then I talked to police station they tried to recognize to to reach the lady and after maybe one hour they they reached her her her her husband and she it it and the and then we realized that she missed her her bag and then maybe and and car wash and someone maybe stole the the the the driver's license and she went she came to the the police station and she talked and she she was thanking me and asking me and she was asking me all the time do you need something from me I she was thankful that I found her ID because she is not local and she would face lots of trouble to renew or to reget her ID back again from the immigration system
KSA_Band_6_35345	the person I know who's doing something to protect the environment is my friend his name is Yusef he works in an animal park here in Dubai he yeah it's it's not that hard for him to do it but sometimes on some days there are types of people who just move on the grass or flowers and those types of things so he his job is to protect these flowers and these plants from them his job is very very important for us and for the people because without the without flowers or without trees we wouldn't be able to get healthy oxygen and we wouldn't be able to get health oxygen and the air would be polluted and there is also like I have another friend who works in a he who lives in a village this in Egypt this friend there is a factory near his village so he gets a lot of polluted air his grandfather died cause of the lung disease
KSA_Band_6_35615	yeah sure actually I love sports a lot and I usually go to gym to do my daily or maybe twice a week exercises like swimming or any other other sports but actually I love to do outside outdoors exercises such as jogging jogging actually I used to walk in the parks which is near to my house daily for one hour because it's healthy but the doctor's on the last visit he told me it's better to run for a while because it's good for your health and it will reduce your weight and your your stomach your stomach that's why I started I start I like to start to go to the park and daily places to do more exercises for walking and for jogging and I am really interesting in the future to to participate in some marathons because you know it make me more energize and it I feel by walking or jogging it it make me rejuvenated and you know energize and it will release all the pressures and the tension from the heavy work which we are facing in daily basis and from our life that's why I am going to start this one because I like it too much and I like the sport facility and we have actually a lot of athletics you know around our area which is provided by government and everybody can access that's why it's good chance for me to use these facilities to improve my jogging and to try to participate in any competition marathon competitions actually
KSA_Band_6_35635	I remember a situation when I helped my younger brother when he ask me for help at the first I ignored him because I have studies and have other business to deal with but then he told me that he got an exam after a week after at math and then he told me that he got some problems with the the questions and he could not answer many questions and he was being me and crying to help me I'd help him at the first I of course ignored him but then I told him that I will help you when I came to help him he was the he was like pleased that I helped him and and he showed me respect because I'm his because I helped him when I start to teach him he was focusing on every single word that I say and he paid attention from me very well when I give him the question and start to illustrate it for him he start to he start to deal with his problems without the with the questions he was he was like he was know he he know the idea but he did not like he did not make it very well at the first but then a few days later he tried to improve hisself he tried to to see the youtube for videos and see how can we how can we do how can we he solve this questions and he start to like practicing and that's they say practice yeah practice makes perfect
KSA_Band_6_35637	actually there are more than one occasion when someone didn't tell me the truth the one that I will say is especially it's special because it's and it's hurt me a lot I invited my cousin to my home and it's happened a lot one of the one of the times I was searching for my gold for the gold necklace and I didn't find it and she was there also I told her that I search about it and I didn't find it and she keep searching with me and she didn't she say that maybe housemaid take it or something like that and we start searching and searching cause nearly two thousand dirham and it was special for me because it's a gift then I told my brother and he said he would look for the police to take a fingerprints from from the cover when he say that she she jumped and put her fingers her whole face and I was shocked from that and she say that no they will they will say that I am the one who stole the I am the one who stole the necklace after that I just ignore the the situation and keep on so one of the days I was talking with her friends by the phone and she said that she my cousin give her a necklace a gold necklace and she ask her to search for another for someone to sell necklace for
KSA_Band_6_35640	regarding the good what is good for my health I think two things are good for not one only me but also for everyone's health which are diet and exercise so healthy diets are really good and serves your health in a good way because when you eat healthy food you first of all you the relax then you keep fat in a good shape and you avoid illness according to me I really don't like fast food or to eat from out outside from the junk food also because it's not healthy at all it's full of sugar and fat and it damages the our cells and it damages our body so I don't usually like to eat fast food or any food from outside according to the exercise I think exercise is very necessary to it helps us to keep flexible to keep fat to keep active and according to me I can say that I am trying to do both of them but I usually depend on healthy diet more than exercise I do exercise whenever I find the time to do especially in this fine weather I I can't lose any way any day without making exercise my favorite exercise is running and yes as I said exercise and health food help keep the diseases away
KSA_Band_6_35643	yes I will tell three different news that I've heard about first of all in the past I heard a news I heard a news about the war that world war two ended it's really in the past but I heard about it and it was a good news it happens in several countries that's why it's called a world war I found about it from people because and television of course because it's an international thing that happened recently however I've heard about an unfortunate war in Arabic countries and it's not really a good news because people are dying and they are devastated and they're have there is hunger in these countries it happened specifically in Syria and Iraq I found about this news from my relatives I have some relatives that are living in Syria and I heard from them when I found about this news I really felt sad for them because it's really hard time to live in while you you don't have peace of mind and in the future I would really like to hear I'd really like to hear that the war ended in the in all over the world actually so that people can live peacefully and happily and it will be good news for all the world and people will stop suffering from everything's even the countries the country itself will stop suffering from what's happen

KSA_Band_6_36277	yes I would like to I would like to begin with explaining what what this type of food is it's actually made of like a full goat which is it's a like it's made of a full goat which is usually cooked under ground for like probably five to six hours so when you remove it from like from the place where is it it's underground the meat is so soft that it it melts in your hand and when it's represented it's represented on a a huge plate with rice and it's presented with toppings such as cashews and some walnuts people now and also like in the old days they used to eat it at special events because it represent that this person is is like he's wealthy because it's made of like a full goat and juice walnuts and these things are expensive in our country and it's full of fat too so when it's full of fat people like it in our country because when they eat it they feel happy because like all they have full because all of the fats and everything coming into your body and this this meal is usually represented also in events such as El Eid which is after Ramadan to to celebrate of the ending of our holy month and all our relatives friends and family members they gather in in in one place which they decide before El Eid in our holy month Ramadan it end the end at end of Ramadan the last ten days and we all gather we start eating having fun and then start drinking tea coffee we chat we talk about each other lives and have fun this meal
KSA_Band_6_36287	yes there is many places that I would go in the future but the most place that I would go is the UK because one of my friend he went there and he said that the place there is beautiful and I really wanted to go there and I saw to the internet and I see a beautiful pictures for the place for the I will go there by the plane because I think by the car it's it's going to be very far and it would take a long time so I think by the plane is the the perfect solution I think that I will visit many places that are near sea and I seen the pictures that I research on the internet and I would wanted to go there because I see in the movies that they make the films there so I would wanted to go there and I will see the places that I saw in the movie and I I maybe did find someone that I know maybe from the movie I see someone and so this is the most important place that I would go to but there's other place that I don't want to go my my family always go in the the UAE like Faijarah or Sharjah these are places that I don't want to go because I've been there and I don't really like them so I would like to go to the UK and that's mean that I will visit another place and I will discover another things and I will see many faces many new faces and there always I will talk in English so it will be a good a good practice for me talk to everyone by English
KSA_Band_6_36289	I have an old friend named Rashan he was with me when I was small in kindergarten we are the best friends we used to help each an other and every moment so when we growed up every we we we're separated because of life he went to another place and I went to an another place so he decided he decided to open a business which is regarding buildings and towers so at first he had a he had a small office and it wasn't successful unfortunately he tried hard and people were helping him and he still didn't make it and then he went into another another business which is opening car modification shop and then he thinked about it and it was like he thinked about it and what's the benefit of it and what are the drawbacks of it so the benefits was he will get more money and more many people will come to him because specially us local people because local people love modifying their cars and they like drag racing and much more so he felt it would be a good business so he started doing it and then people came to him but after couple of years we heard that
KSA_Band_6_36407	yes actually the question asked me if when I found something that someone had lost it and my answer is that it's I found one watch special watch to one of my closest friends his name is Ahmed actually he was watching one of the football matches in on TV in my home specifically in the living room and after that after finishing the match after finishing watching the match and we had dinner he left the he left the home the next day he called me and he asked me if you found anything missing because he didn't find his watch after that I looked through all the the home and I found it it's he forget it in the table and it was a special and why it was that so much special to him and it was priceless because it was a gift from his grandmother and he loves his grandmother so much that's why I I was happy to find that gift for him and in order to save his because he was very worried and he you can say he kept searching it the whole day now for like for almost six hours in his car in his home even in the gym that he used to practice on but he didn't find it and when I found it I immediately told him after that and I took the watch by myself and I went to his home to give it to him and he was very happy and when I see the happiness in his face also I feel that he gave me that positive vibes and that put positive energy which reminds me of my own grandmother also and how how how she was so much special to me also and how much she how she used to give me so many gifts in my birthdays or in any special occasions or even when I succeeded in any special in any special when I did any achievements either in my work or in my studies so this kind of a small thing even though this watch it doesn't cost so much it's not like it doesn't cost so much in money but the way that he felt it and the
KSA_Band_6_36469	yeah the yes in fact the one I'd like to study and work with is my colleague can I tell you his name? his name is Ahmed in fact we started our career together here like twenty four years ago the one thing I like about him that he's very optimistic and hard working he likes a lot to to work and to study and and he I I usually call him like you know not to but he's a sort of actor he likes to study a lot he likes to look for information and working with him or beside him is like a privilege to me in fact he used to give me some advice especially with the with IELTS for example with the with the reading stuff with the writing stuff which was in in fact the advice was very beneficial for me what work did we work together what things did we work together when we when we were like studying or sorry teaching at the same school we tend to do like PD session for the other teacher in the field of teaching and also methodology or class classroom management and this one was very beneficial specially once we start to distribute the rule the rules among us and he started or lead then I follow then I lead and he follows it goes like a lot of harmony between it it's seem it seems like a lot of harmony is going on between us and this was very beneficial and I like it and I want to to do that experience one more time if it is possible
KSA_Band_7_35210	around eight years ago I wanted to start my own business so it was like a very good chance to make a new business in real state but as I'm a my teacher it's not easy to start in this field it's not my career at all so but I contacted with some friends they told me there is a great movement in my country Egypt now so if you at least buy a piece of land even very small it will grow your your money quick and faster than working as a teacher for many years so I started to think about it and I tried to collect some moneys some money and I contacted my sister some of my friends to share me but they didn't and at the same time I got a call from my friend he was here in Dubai for years and he asked me we need a a teacher urgently so I didn't have much time to think it was around four days so I started to apply and sent him a photocopy of my passport and my picture and then he sent me the visa I didn't finish my business so I went later at the summer holiday but I catch up but not the same chance you know because the chance does repeat again but you will never lose the chances so at this time I didn't regret regret but I feel like if I started this business at the time maybe it's it's better than now but anyway I I'm glad for the everything happened
KSA_Band_7_35222	yes actually the news that it was recently advertised and then and the in the media it was in my country actually it's related to they will start building new metro route that will cover multiple cities in in my country actually currently we are using buses and cars so it is like it will be a big achievement when it will start that happened they they advertised one year back so now they are in stage you know for building the infrastructure and you know the stations between the cities they will start in one the first phase will start from the capital to the second biggest city in my country then there will be different phases later that will cover all the cities from north to south and then you all people you know are happy to to hear this news it will be somehow from financial point of view to save a lot of of money they will it will be somehow the tickets will be cheap and it will you know distribute people to use multiple transportation ways not only buses and cars now there will there will be metros so you can say crowd issue will be somehow resolved this news was you now advertised in the media and the internet social media as well and the the feedback was very positive from from the people many recommendation and encouragement about this step according to the media this will take about to to finalize the first phase of the project it will take two years then they they will continue with the remaining phases they cover all the cities
KSA_Band_7_35247	yes the person is Oprah Winfrey I like her personality and how she overcome the obstacles in her life like starting with her career like also she could overcome the personal incidents that happened to her the harmful ones I really found her inspiring as a woman as a strong woman and I watch her videos all the time like to get to to get like motivated and inspiring and even when I feel down sometimes I just watch her like how she like about her story about how she gives speeches to people and to encourage encourage them how to like to go on and move on and not to give up on on on things how I heard about her in the TV shows definitely what interesting things about she has done like she from personal side that she has overcome many bad incidents happened to her I really found her courage and bold to do these things to to have done these things and also to share it with everyone do everyone can benefit and like get like an experience and lessons and yeah yeah what else I would like I would like to know about how she was thinking when she was young and the way she process things like when she was alone there was nothing no one to support her so how what she was telling herself to be honest like from inside like what she was like this is something if I meet her I will ask her this question because sometimes when I face things like I'm alone I don't know what to tell myself I know I say okay go on move on like don't stop here but sometimes we need like a strong question or a strong motivation to
KSA_Band_7_35249	yes I'm going to talk about French language because the French language is really delicate and many people especially in our countries like the Egypt usually use French since I was maybe ten years old I have been studying other languages but I was never really that interested in them but when I first thought about travelling and going somewhere else the first country that I really wanted to go to was Spain but then I didn't like I opened the internet and I tried started to research on Spanish but it was not you know my something that I would like to study so the second country that I would that I would've liked to go to is France so France is a a really nice place to go to because I researched and I tried to find out about it and French is not as difficult as I thought it was be because it is really close to my mother tongue which is Arabic and to try to learn this language I have started to find or come in contact with many schools that teach languages hm I'm still thinking I'm just still choosing which school should I go to and not done with that thought and it would for me it would really be difficult to start learning a new language because it's something that I've never tried before and learning a new language for anyone is dfficult to start but then as as you go on and as you start learning it will be easy but it it takes time just to be to be able to learn and be able to just pass through the language as everyone says and also a major a major idea that I would like because if I want to learn to French for is that I would like to be multilingual
KSA_Band_7_35251	yeah actually I would like to talk about the cotton plant in Egypt because cotton plant it's originally grown in our upper Egypt because Egypt is divided into three regions it's grown in upper Egypt and this cotton plants is very important to my home country since there are a lot of advantages of this plant it's support the industrial and also agriculture industry in in my home country in Egypt and it's also giving the full support and also already our country is very very well known of the good cotton quality because whenever we're using cotton in the linens and all of that it's very good it's getting very good quality and according to that basic of this cotton it's giving us sort of of support because we can export this cotton or this plant or the linens of this cotton to the foreign countries and also to the neighbor countries and it improves our economical situation and the makes us gives us the full support to improve the foreign currency in my home country so it has very good return on the impact of the industrial revolution in my home country that's why I I'm thinking in the future to have any personal business to be related to the cotton like linens and towels and auto industries that's why it can support me and my home country as well
KSA_Band_7_35254	actually I had the problem with the piece of equipment it was the printer I had the printer and once it stopped it was like maybe two months back I really was in need of this printer right now at the time but I don't know what type of cartirdge went out of ink papers like went went inside and got stuck and I had to print at the same time because it was something so urgent so like I went to change the cartridge I put the new cartridge didn't work even so that was like a big problem that I faced that I need the papers right now and printer's not working I removed the cartridge I tried to clean inside what's inside the the the stick it's like a stick inside I tried to clean it well and then like remove the papers that got stuck inside changed the cartridge both the black and colored ones then after like an hour maybe i left it alone it didn't work so I kept on moving the printer like I went like crazy trying to do anything in it to work and then like i left it for an hour it worked alone I don't know how at this time like I felt so nervous cause I was really like the time was so short and I had to get this paper it was so important paper so like I tried my best to fix it as like I don't have the equipments for for fixing this but i tried my best to fix it and I changed the cartridge I I tried to remove papers and so on so it was like one problem I can't say more than one
KSA_Band_7_35269	yes actually I I would like to study indoor we have in our our work premises we have something called a a knowledge center this this knowledge center it's like a big library it has a lot of boxes and a lot of different boxes that have different topics and all the stuff from our organization they are usually visit this knowledge center and they spend a lot of time there by studying as there is an internal policy from our organization that we can use this knowledge center like one hour each day for the stuff and the place is very nice and it's a little bit quiet and there is a lot of books you can carry with to to your home you can borrow you can use it inside outside the center and it's a well educated place and a very nice place that we can study there and this place is is cost our organization more than six hundred thousand dirhams for reinovation and to buy a lot of boxes to make it available for all the stuff that's around three thousand stuff that we have in Dubai customs every day in the early morning I'm going there I'm taking some topic and start studying for one hour before the duty start and the place is very nice and very quiet to study so I like it too much and I prefer I advise all my colleagues to visit this place and to start studying there because they cannot find a place like this and our top management is encouraging the the culture policy in our internal organization

KSA_Band_7_35576	okay the most important decision was entering the university it was very hard decision because it there is a lot of university a lot of majors and it was very we were very busy with our studies and you have to apply directly to the university and have application you have a deadline so my family and friends they have suggested to me to go to a land university to experience like a new lifestyle to go away to have new experience to engage with another people and be independent basically so then I have decided to go to a land university and it was the best decision that I have made I met a lot of people intelligent people I grew my career there and also I have decided the major that I love now and I'm passionate about it which is architecture engineering and it was very nice experience it was very different experience actually and because it made me what I am now to give me more opportunities and the and the people there were very friendly very helpful they help me toward my studies and to my career there
KSA_Band_7_35577	yeah so I would like to talk about Dubai here in in United Arab Emirates so I live here since I was born if I if I want to talk about Dubai it has like a combination of both of nature and the tecnhology and the new buildings and stuff so regarding the nature it has the beach sea and what beautiful views and with the good weather in winter people are attracted more to this to this city from all over the world and they come to enjoy the weather here which is not very cold and at the same time it is warm and and good during the day also it has malls and I mean the skyscrapers the long buildings which attracts also more people if we talk about the brands in the malls and how much people now are keen to go and buy from new brands and fashion shows so we will that's why I mean that's why I think Dubai is a really attractive city to people from outside other than that like everyday there is a new event or a new activity in Dubai a new concerts a new like charity organization every day there is a new thing and everyday there is like different activity that will encourage people to come to this city if I talk to why this city is most the most famous thing in the city is actually burj kalifa burj kalifa I'll choose the tallest building in the world it's really beautiful place of it is was built by a very famous
KSA_Band_7_35583	Yeah actually because I'm reading a lot of books so it was difficult for me to pick one book however I can see that I am reading a lot of life I like reading a lot of like coaching books and improving skills as well as spiritual books like all those kinds of life improving skills books I feel like so one of the books that I really like it and I feel like it provides the needs of the new generation books is this book is the author the author was a sorority woman she is a life coach so her book it was different for me to experience this kind of book with different structure contents it was like covering most of the more than approximately 300 common problems that people may face it so it was very to the point no that deep explanation like see the all this books is like explaining one one point in more than five ten pages and you feel like I've got it so I don't need like this whole explanation to one point but for her book it was only one page for each issue so she stated the problem and then she put why do experience this problem for example the message behind it and then she gives a solution or action how you can act to learn from this promise you will not happened again in your life so I really I I like the way she wrote the book it was really nice I feel like sometimes so you have just you don't have to read the whole book you just open to a new experience
KSA_Band_7_35728	sure so I would prefer if I can go back to the period of the ancient Egypt era where there was the the pyramids and the the people with their culture with their traditions with their I I would like to know more about them because actually we didn't study much about them in school even though I feel that it is interesting getting to go deeper and deeper to know why did they choose such a lifestyle how did they build the pyramids how did they survive living in deserts maybe although we are here in a desert country so yes I would like to go to that period of time I became interested in this period actually I am a fan of Egyptian movies and some of them they are like comedian and they're imitating this style so I started thinking of some details that are we didn't know about it even when we google it of course you cannot take the exact picture as in the nature how how how much I know about the spirit and history actually I I don't know much about it but all I know that it was like I don't remember exactly what what we studied about it but I I think that it is a great experience to to live there in the situation in their place in their culture
KSA_Band_7_36002	okay I actually paid treadmill two years ago I was I running I was I was suffering from obesity I was 85 kgs actually and I wanted to lose my weight in ways so I paid a treadmill I paid okay I bought it online actually and it I already my bought it because I wanted to lose weight but it actually I found it useless because when I bring it home it takes the largest room from the house it was that large size not the small size and I did not make use of it because I already just start in a gym it there is nothing lets you silent make sorry when you're when you're not alone at home there's nothing that urges you to go on to begin doing your exercises but when I'm going to the gym I find that there is no difference that I supporting me urging me to go on to do exercise but at home I did not prefer I find it useless after I bring it actually even my husband he is suffering from obesity he is almost 140 kgs he was so excited for that idea of having a treadmill treadmill at home but also he did not make us of that he usually going outside he prefers going outside and have a walk so that he can breathe he can see he can have more some friends going walking outside with him better than looking at and it's not a treadmill in itself is not useful actually because there is many other exercises you have to do to build muscles it's a kind of cardio you know when walking its kind of cardio you will not that muscles it will not make you lose that weight maybe you are burning some calories only so now when I when I am when I am going to the gym I usually begin warmup on the treadmill after that I begin taking a rest no sorry I begin
KSA_Band_7_36037	okay okay upon a time I was walking with my mother in the cornmaze and actually we found some money it was like ten Dirhams and then my mother said like this is from God this money was sent from God I told her Mom this was this definitely belong belongs to someone so you need to return it so we actually was holding the money and walking around the cornmaze asking if you to close people nearby like we just was like okay a close distance from the way the the place we found the money so when we just reach to our specific place we stand there just ask for the people who was walking around if you saw somebody who lost money or if it belongs to someone or if if this is your money so we actually couldn't find the the owner so we decided to give it to any security guy over there so at that time we just give it to that person actually and we just left so we we like like say the okay we stop here we have nothing to do more and we just left so my mother said like she she was scolding me like why did you actually give it to him this was like from God we can just keep it like no this is not good and you actually told me not to do that before and you actually saying the opposite like mom please this is like double standard or what so she actually laughed and said this is this is the right way to do it so yeah I hadn't thought about finding this thing okay for a while I thought about her about what she said and its like maybe yes this is like from God but its just like ten Dirhams this was like nothing no so yeah I feel bad like what what I would do if I was that was the in the place of that person himself
KSA_Band_7_36050	Okay the subject that I didn't enjoy at school but I'm interested in now is French I have always been it has been always hard for me to study languages how long I have studied the subject at school I have studied it for four semesters of for a role I didn't enjoy it back then because it was very hard for me to study a new language that I am not familiar with my first language is Arabic and I've always learned English at school but then suddenly they have asked us to learn French I didn't enjoy it also because it didn't interest interest me back then and I didn't see any point of studying it but the French language interests me now because I am I am applying to the Emirates diplomacy academy at Abu Dabi and they have asked us to study a new language so between French and Spanish I decided to go with the French language because at least I have the background I have because I have studied I have studied back at school it was really hard for me to study the back at school because the first two semesters I was out outside the country so I didn't get the basic of the French language French language so when I came back I have missed most of the the classes and I think there are specific parts in the brain that are responsible for the for studying a new language and
KSA_Band_7_36260	okay so there's one time that I really wish to have airpods cause everyone nowadays had airpods and me and my mom couldn't afford it and one day one day me and my brothers we went out to center to watch a movie and he ask me do you have airpods so I was like no he was like okay let's go to the shop he didn't say nothing he was like let's see so we went we saw and then we saw new new type of airpods and that I thought oh okay no it's nine hundred Durhams it was too expensive so he just told me what do you think so he he gave me an option a pink one or black one so I was like black one he said no why not just take the pink one he was joking around I'm like no no no jallas okay but nevermind and then he just took the airpods he ask the employee that he wanted to buy it I'm like are you gonna buy it for yourself he's like guess so we went to the cashier he bought it and just took it back and he gave it to me here here I really I didn't expect it at all it was so unexpected you know that time it was so I couldn't express my feelings I was so happy like I kissed my brother my on his forehead and I'm like thank you thank you thanks so much I was so happy I can't even express my feelings I can't explain it and why did I wanted this way because so a lot all of my friends were like showing off with their airpods and stuff so i had this wired earphones and you know sometimes I be embarrassed to wear them so nowadays I don't even wear earphones cause I love listening to music whenever I come home I always taking my gaming headset I listen to music or I use my mom's earphones you know and then now I have my airpods that my brother gave it to me I appreciate it so much for him even every nowadays I call him saying how are you and this and that you know basically appreciation and stuff and then there's one day that my my other brother
KSA_Band_7_36276	yes I can so the my idea of a perfect house is that this house would be located in a certain place which is not that crowded and i think it should be so it has good furniture everything is perfect in the house no leaks no problems in the house that can affect the people in the house like you would not like it if you would get family or friends in the house and there is a problem like the AC's not working or something like this especially in the UAE because in the UAE you have mostly for like eight months probably you will have hot weather so I think AC is one of the most important things and furniture and then we you need to have a good physical shape for the house so you everyone that comes to the house he needs to be comfortable he need to give treat them with good things and they need to be you they need to feel relaxed in the house and because if the house was not looking good and everything was not fine people would not like to come and meet you because to be a problem to them to sit in hot weather or feel unrelaxed so I think that would be an issue so what would this house look like to be perfect or good I think it should it i think the physical shape from the outside doesn't really matter I think in my own opinion I think it needs to be looking good from the inside just be clean not messed up things on the floor no I think it should be nice and clean and everything is fine and put in in the right place for it and special features that this house would have is that have it should have like a place for making food like fire a fireplace so that people can chill and just relax have some coffee talk about certain things discuss things in a comfortable way so this house would be perfect for me because I'm a I'm the kind of person that likes to invite
KSA_Band_7_36288	growing up I admired someone that is I describe as an someone who gives hope to people he was my super hero and I think he's I know he's a lot also he's a super hero to he's a hero to so many people the person is super man Clark Kent I knew him from TV shows that I used to watch when I was yeah a child I still watches watch it till now he was my super hero he was my I wanted to be like him I want to be strong fast and have a laser vision and then x-ray vision I wanted to help people I wanted especially I wanted to help my father and mother because we struggled a lot grow in our earliest years superman was the he is the person who you depend on he will rescue you no matter what and he will always be there for you as I said he gives hope to people and I want I wanted to be and I still want to be a person who gives hope to others and inspire them to do more to achieve what they cannot and what they believe they cannot do I wanted to motivate people I still now my father always say to me be a leader being a leader is not giving others order and forcing them to do things for you but being a leader is
KSA_Band_8_33137	I will be talking about the stuff I made for my friends and family by hand in the past I used to do letters for my friend and my family as I didn't basically have enough money to do something really out of the box, so I used to write I used to write my love and affection for my friends and family on that letter and would basically design it with some stickers and hearts and some of my child strengths they I used to do it because I I used to love seeing the reaction on their faces knowing that they are being loved by me and and I really care what they do what however right now in the present now that I'm older and understand the teenager life how what teenagers would like to have I would get some flowers and boxes and get really creative basically for my friends and family so that so that they really love it and post it on snapchat and instagram and mention me of course now in the present I usually like to take a really plain box fill it with flower petals mainly red or or black if it was for a boy basically and write a couple of letters here and there and just make something really nice like a ludo game or snake or the ladder and just put it in there and close it and wrap it all in a nice really no no nice really how can I explain how can I mention the shape more of like can you speak about shape I don't know how to explain the shape but however in the future I would really love to make a piece of art for them as that would be really out of the box and be extremely amazing and ravishing basically in that
KSA_Band_8_33169	Firstly I think couple of weeks back the Pope Francis came to UAE to Abu Dhabi that was great news cause I knew ever since let's say the incidents of 2001 this is what he said in his meeting with one of the sheikhs in UAE he felt there was tension between Muslims and Christians I'm not really into that kind of topic but I believe that's that's where I'm gonna head my piece right now so when he arrived here first day I believe was Monday and he went to state he had had a meeting with one of the sheikhs of UAE they had a peace treaty talk they signed three documents one for UAE one for the Vatican and one for history I believe it was in Abu Dhabi Tuesday there was a mass from four till ten I'm not really sure about the details of this but just saying I tried applying to work for that mass as a volunteer it it would have been a great opportunity to hang out my friends for over two days cause you have to be there at eight pm on a Monday and then they'll take you there you practice at twelve and then you'll attend the mass volunteering-wise and then they'll send you home the next day so it would've been a great extracurricular activity with my friends to hang out enjoy time and we we would've got paid for it so that's that's quite good news and the certificate if they would have given would have had a quite a good reputation the Pope doesn't come to Abu Dhabi every every week so the going there just for once would've been amazing but last minute all of us got disqualified I'm not really sure why we all had the experience we all had we all were free that date all schools across Dubai got a holiday on Tuesday because of his presence but it it wasn't just being disqualified that didn't matter see when we all heard the idea that we were gonna get paid eveybody instantly started planning what they're gonna do with that six hundred Dirhams
KSA_Band_8_33620	so I bought a car back in when I used to live in Saudi Arabia before I joined the American University of Sharjah the reason I bought it in Saudi Arabia is that to get from one place to the other it's a very long distance and the public transportation over there it's not very good so you actually need a car or you're gonna pay a lot of money on taxes so this is why I bought it the reason I'm not using it very much in the last four years when I was in when i'm in the American University of Sharjah is that I only use it to get to Dubai but once I'm in Dubai cause it's cause there is a lot of traffic and all that I generally use the public transportation as it can get you nearly everywhere and plus it costs less than fuel and you would save a lot of time that you would waste on traffic I like the Dubai metro and another reason is I for for the past three years I've been on the soccer team of my university and I like to get active and all that I would rather walk if the weather is good then take a car and all that so yeah that's basically it another reason is that the increased amount of accidents that happen due to the traffic might might cause lots of deaths and injuries and all that so I'd rather stay safe use a metro or a or public bus where it's much safer than driving a car on the highway where speeds can reach up to hundred thirty kilometer per hour so
KSA_Band_8_33632	alright time when I felt proud of a of a friend's success this is a friend of mine who's a childhood friend and I grew up with her her name is Mariam and she was a very she was a wild character with a tomboy personality when she was young so a lot of people would always try to stand her ground they would try to remind her that you have to lady-like you're a girl and she was a huge fan of football at the time and to this day she's still a huge fan of football and I think this is one of the one one of the this is one of the proudest moments I've been for a friend because she is a huge fan of Manchester United and a huge fan of Sir Alex Ferguson so and knowing all about his life and studying his life she was able to translate his his autobiography into Arabic the whole four hundred plus paged autobiography was able to translate it into Arabic and she posted it on Twitter not expecting the fame she would get for it and after a while she was recognized by the official team as the official I don't know the correct term which is used for her title at the moment but she is a a head in the football fan club of the UAE currently and you can find her name on the website so I think that was a very proud moment she got lots of publicity that she deserves she got to speak about her her hobby that she enjoyed as a young child and what people made fun of her before now recognize her for it which is amazing and I find any of my friends' successes a happy moment for me so I'm happy for her and she deserves the recognition she gets now
KSA_Band_8_34181	I'd like my house to be in a quiet place near the mountains or the sea I'd like it to look like a cottage or small studio I would have modern feel to it because I am a little introverted and I'd like to stay alone so had it would have places like a fireplace little kitchen for myself till just a modern feel to it just in general I'd like it to be in a quiet place and can have different features like pool or an art room cause I myself like to enjoy art and I I like to draw and paint so I'd have a a room for painting and drawing
KSA_Band_8_34356	sure so a time when I had to change a plan suddenly was actually when I wanted to apply for my Bachelor's degree in university I was always hoping that I would go somewhere abroad or even if I stayed in Dubai I wanted an American university that was private and growing up I've always been in an American academy since I was a kid even though I'm like born Emirati my grandfather said that he felt that I was moving away from my heritage due to my social life and the academic lifestyle that I had and he told me that it was best to actually come to Zayed University and get a Bachelor's from here just because it's a government university and it's all Emiratis and it would help me come back to my culture so I decided to I I was like why not let me just try something new in my life and honestly I can say that it's been the best decision that I've ever taken I changed the plan very last minute I was supposed to go to American university of Dubai but during the same summer like maybe two months before I completely applied to Zayed University and I got there for fall semester and it's really helped me in my academic and career development so yeah that's the plan
KSA_Band_8_34589	I've known a family business that has been very successful is it's a family business that's related to jewelry such as Rolex and many other brands worldwide that are very well-known and they're authentic I know about the business because my parents have purchased many products from them they have pre-ordered and ordered and sold their old items to the business I think most of the customers that go to buy things from which is called are mostly women because the brands sold are mostly related to jewelry high jewelry which is like necklaces and bracelets and rings much more the other type of customers could be men who go there to purchase watches which are given at a better rate than the actual boutique which makes the brand very successful and well-known in our country have been opened here since a very long time in the United Arab Emirates and it's a very well-known business family between the Arab world I I really think the business is very successful because they have been trying to improve ever since they have opened by opening up new brands in their boutique they have opened new branches in all around the Emirates they have also made it easier for others to purchase items that aren't really available in the malls or in the actual boutique of the brand so it's like another seller for the same items
KSA_Band_8_34622	so last year my friend and I joined a boxing club where we had to like practice every day to learn to towards the goal of entering a tournament and hopefully winning so him and I we both signed up for this club we we trained hard for six months straight during school time and when when the time came for the tournament it was it was like a knockout stage tournament so whoever won moved on to the next stage and whoever lost got dropped out I was in the tournament with him I was on the other side of the bracket so we I got to the I think quarter-finals and lost that game he managed to go all the way through the to the final and actually win the match he won it by I think it was a a judge point so this this achievement for for me was like the ultimate goal winning a boxing tournament it was like global not just the the UAE but it was global so for for him I think this was the best thing he ever did in his life because his father was a boxing champion as well so he wanted to take on his father's steps and be like be a champion like him so winning this tournament not only got got him like propelled him towards his goal he got the he was catching eyes from everywhere even the sheikh the sheikh of Ajman at the sheikh sheikh Omar actually met with him took some photos he then sent him to America he met some other boxing champions I think he he has a picture with with Anthony Joshua when he was at the at the Madison Square Garden the reason why I felt so proud of him is because he achieved something I couldn't he like for me we've always looked at each other as like we're equals
KSA_Band_8_34721	the first thing or sorry the thing someone really sorry can I repeat the thing that someone gave me that I really wanted was my first pet which is a cat my mother gave this to me when I was around seven years old cause when I was younger I was really lonely my my brother used to play with his friends and I was usually home alone cause my parents were working all the time so I always like wished for a cat and I even told my mother that I really wanted a cat to be with me and so I can cling to it and eventually I got one and his name is Simpson he's a boy and I still have him to this day and I was really happy when I first got him because I really felt connected with my cat like we were one person I wouldn't go out without him even though cats don't really like going out my cat was really scared of going out and I usually just drag him even though he wouldn't like it and when I first got it I was actually scared as well because I was scared that they would bite me or scratch me and I still have scars from him cause he's really aggressive sometimes cause I usually annoy him and yeah my cat is Persian and we got him from my my dad's friend who's also his boss and I was really thrilled when I got him because I didn't feel lonely anymore and
KSA_Band_8_34726	okay so I believe gifts that are made by hand are more important or hold a more emotional aspect to it than gifts you buy so a gift that I made for a relative she was my aunt I crocheted a hat for her not for her actually she was holding a baby shower and so I crocheted a little hat that was pink in color with dark pink flowers I did that so it took me a lot of time to crochet this hat because I've never attempted to crochet a hat before so first I had to learn through Youtube tutorials and Youtube videos and then I had to collect some ideas from sites such as Pinterest and after I've learned the basics I started doing a lot by myself of course I've had a lot of failed attempts but after these failed attempts I finally knew how to crochet a hat and I did it it was not the best hat you can have but it was something and once she saw it she was really happy she was happy with the fact that I actually tried to do something and not just buy it it was really difficult to make as I've said before because I've never had the chance do this it was a bit different than what I always do which is just buy gifts normally but she was she was a special aunt for me because she was the youngest and we spend a lot of time together what else another gift that I gave my friend after I've done the hat decided to crochet more and so I've done a lot more gifts instead of buying them one thing I did was a little teddy bear keychain for a friend that I had since she collects a lot of teddy bears in her room and so I decided to crochet a small one that looks exactly like her favorite teddy bear it was brown in color and it had these blue eyes I've no idea why she liked it but I did it anyway and she loved it and she has it on her car
KSA_Band_8_34738	one of the foods that I really like and it's actually always present in any kind of occasion I visit it's waraq'inab or we can call it like grape leaves in English every country like especially Arabian countries are like famous with this with this kind of food Syria especially is like world-wide known for making the best waraq'inab and I specially like the one which is in vegetables it has two types one vegetables and one with meat or I prefer the one with vegetables and I like it cold mostly what makes this food very special to me is that when I was young when I when we used to visit Syria my grandmother she passed away like recently whenever we used to go for holiday she used to make this for me especially and whenever she used to kind of have us like the first day we had in Syria it should always be present with alongside other foods on the table and since then it became a kind of a a relationship I built with my grandmother so it makes this food very specal to me usually it's made you you get you get the grape leaves they they're usually in the supermarket like very often you would find them and then you have rice and you don't do it fully-cooked rice because you are gonna cook it afterwards with the grape leaves and then you cook the onion tomato sauce alongside like other spices sometimes I think spinach also is added or any type another type of greenery and then you kind of cook them all together put them in the like grape leaf roll it and line them up in the like in the trigger pan and then you it usually takes four to five hours to be cooked takes a long time but it's like my favorite food ever and last week I went to a wedding before my grandma passed she was with me and they presented that food in the wedding she was like do you remember when you were a child and I used to cook this for you and like present
KSA_Band_8_34743	so the person the grandparent that I will be talking about's actually my grandfather my grandfather is right now in his late eighties and he's been working as an he used to work as an accountant actually accounting was the only job he ever had as far as I know and he started with it at an early age there wasn't a proper degree that you got for accounting back in the days they didn't always go to university or gain a Bachelor's degree before starting work but bit by bit he made a name for himself and people our hometown would come to him for running their accounting books or so for their tiny businesses and I remember even when he was really old I would see him still sitting during all the and all of it of course was done mentally mental mathematics without the calculator he would just sit and keep on scribbling that is not too long ago like maybe ten years ago he was still doing that so I see him even as an elder still having his math skills that would fascinate me actually and he's pretty known in our home town for this I believe that using his his math skills throughout his life and even into his late years helped him keep his his his mentality bright his mind sharp when you talk to him until now he is very how can I describe it as very entertaining to talk to he has a very sharp memory and that could've been really enhanced by his mathematical skills which he did not stop using during the years and accounting is something that I had considered as a as influence from my grandfather
KSA_Band_8_34767	so the history I'm I'm intrigued in is it dates back to fifteen hundreds when England and Scotland and France were having constant conflicts you could say I'm not sure about the dates if it's like fourteen hundreds or fifteen hundreds and how the United Kingdom became like how Scotland and England joined together because they were they were against each other like with the Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary of Scotland they were they were like they were rivals because they both had a claim to the throne and I know this a lot because I've watched a show it talked briefly about it it it's merely drama but it I I learned many things so I kept researching about it and reading more about the like the true events that happened and not the the emphasized one in the show with the drama okay and how I want to learn more about Queen Mary In the show she's she's more she's more important she's the she's the main character of the show she's the protagonist but Queen Elizabeth is not as important in the show in the show I'm interested in learning about both so she like how she was claimed to have to like how oh yeah
KSA_Band_8_34816	so something that I bought and not used very much I would say is an i Pad I bought it at around like I had like I was starting unversity and ending with my high school years and I thought I would like it because I would use it taking notes digitally and writing online while the professor was talking opening online books and instead of having a physical book and it was I thought it would be convenient instead of carrying a book and then a laptop and my notes it's just one object a gadget and it would be easier for me to go in a university classes but I noticed that I prefer my laptop and also I'm used to also my i Phone like you would think i Phones are small but now with the generation it's getting bigger so it's almost like an i Pad and I like taking notes through either writing or I still prefer writing and I prefer my laptop if I open emails I I do not like the touchscreen and navigating I still prefer my physical small laptop it's still and my i Phone and and I I like taking notes so I thought that it was the least gadget that I bought I thought also I would like it because it will be small easy to like use Face Time and cause I'm away from my family so I would speak to them but I again it's you're so stuck to your i Phone that you neglect something called an i Pad also I I I would say that if if anything I would I would really think of reselling the i Pad I I've tried giving it away to my parents but they prefer the new generation it's very old but I yeah it was my biggest I would say my biggest mistake cause I really like to what I buy I make sure that I really like it I really wanna use it
KSA_Band_8_34837	one of the places I would really love to visit in the future is Bora Bora I've heard a lot of people talking about them I've seen a lot of pictures online the thing is with Bora Bora is that it's really really far so I have to be like really ready to go to the airplane ride which is really long cause it's on the other side of the continent and then after the airplane I'd have to go into a bus and then after the bus into a boat trip to reach to the place so it takes a lot to get there but I really like it cause it's just mesmerizing I really love the place it's really relaxing you can see the clear ocean and you just like to swim there and just have a very stress free time basically and just like enjoy the time there I would as I said I would travel using plane an airplane cause it's the an the easiest way to go there and I would try maybe kayaking there I would try snorkling there cause I've never tried these kinds of sport here I would just try to try new things and go out of my comfort zone just to have fun while living my life I would really like it there cause it's different than where I usually travel I usually go to London Germany and like it's the same thing every time it's the city center the crowded places it's not something new and relaxing you know when we go there our focus is shopping, sightseeing just walking around sitting in cafes
KSA_Band_8_34860	so my favorite childhood game was actually on the Play Station three the franchise was called Call of Duty and the title which was released was Black Ops two and I found it very fun because it was a great way to involve me and my classmates in a very interactive game which is multiplayer so what we used to do were we would party up together we will go online and we just you know practice our game style practice us as a team so it really helped me with my teamwork so what do we do then after a lot of practice we would go into actual tournaments against like people across the globe these tournaments had like cash prizes and I think my favorite moment was when we ended up winning the major it was held here in Dubai it was in Mirdif City Centre and it really taught me many aspects like teamwork it taught me how to communicate better I met a lot of people and one of my favorite things is that it helped me connect with everyone around the globe so I have now met so many different friends so many different cultures and now it's like you know I know many people like like across the globe and that's it that's all I have
KSA_Band_8_34871	recently I've been more into meditation and as well as therapy I think that mental health does contribute to physical health when I started I started to wake up in the morning and the first thing that I do is meditate I take around five to ten minutes a day and then I also go to therapy once a week a lot of people think that of just eating well or exercising is key to a better lifestyle but I also think that if you have great mental health it contributes to a better lifestyle I started doing doing it when I started to have anxiety issues and so on and at first it was very challenging to keep up with meditation because you need to relax and just focus on your breathing but as I as I keep doing it it becomes easier and easier to do and you can do it for a longer period of time without being distracted another thing I'd say would be the therapy as I mentioned going I'd recommend for anyone to just go once a week even if you don't have any mental illnesses just go there and talk and you actually can find ways to help yourself oh another thing would be it's linked to meditation waking up early and sleeping early as well I used to stay up long hours till two am three am as most people here and then I I go
KSA_Band_8_35199	I'll be talking about a business that actually is something very trendy these days which is a food business it's the business is runned by a family member she's a relative and she opened her Instagram account a few years ago and she sells traditional UAE food through the social media actually her business was successful because nowadays people look for new things and new types of foods she she didn't you know keep it natural and you know the trend she tried to changed it it to change it and put a twist into it for example one time she sent over her famous or our famous traditional food the chicken biryani however she put it into small like plates the that is that has a perfect portion for a person to eat so it was actually a really nice and thoughtful idea of her her business wasn't wasn't known by a lot of customers at first however because here you know in our family we tend to tell each other the what's new around or new things coming up so she she told us and then we told our other relatives and that's how it worked and so through this communication around us we made we we told a lot of people about her business and they've come to known her and know her food and bought from her a couple of times and it was always very nice or they always had a very nice
KSA_Band_8_35335	one of the main issues we have including our appliances or equipment is my mom's TV it's always broken or not working and she always relies on me to fix it even though even though it started breaking when I was younger when I was around eleven to like around that age through my teenage years so she'd always depend on me to fix the problem even though I had no idea what I was doing so I'd always call the cable company which would leave me on hold for like half an hour and I'd just wait I did not enjoy it very much and my mom just kept screaming at me she always keeps screaming at me and she she would frustrate me even more than I was already frustrated with the cable company so my mom doesn't speak English so I am supposed to talk in her stead all the time so it's kind of my responsibility to do whatever she wants me to do including her technical issues or issues in public I'd always stand in line for her and talk in her stead so I grown kind of used to it as the years go by so at first I used to get very frustrated but every year it's less and less frustration for me and I'm growing to understand where she's coming from she wasn't educated in she wasn't educated to speak English so I understand that she needs me to do it all the things she can't do and that's the story of my mom and I feel like these issues are very common sometimes the washing machine breaks and I have to fix it and she she'd always ask me about the buttons and sometimes I don't even know what the buttons mean
KSA_Band_8_35364	yes so I love Barcelona we've been we've been to Barcelona I believe in August twenty sixteen such a lovely city full full of cultures you know we've been to different churches different museums etcetera the food was great local Spanish tapas so that was wonderful you could walk everywhere which is you know living in Dubai it's sometimes too hot to walk to walk around but Barcelona was was really good for that it was highly recommended to me by my friends and colleagues so that was part of the reason why I went to Barcelona we took a nice drive also by the coast so in addition to culture food it's really nice scenery especially if you're driving by the coast and you go to all the small towns explore different beaches and also definitely we visited the Camp Nou which is the stadium of the famous club Barcelona and there was a huge part of that dedicated to Messi the most famous player so yeah overall it was an fantastic trip and I'd highly recommend it to anyone
KSA_Band_8_35572	so I borrowed a book from my friend she like everybody knows that I love to read and like some would just describe as a bookworm that I I just that I love reading that much she read the book and she told me the story of the book and she said that she really enjoyed it so she gave it to me in school I read it and it was amazing and the story it was it was Me Before You I think the story and it has a movie that they they created a movie about it it's a person that can't move he's like paralyzed from the the chest down I think and they're he has he he needs a like someone to take care of him and there is a girl that doesn't have any experience in this field and she works for then she goes to work for him and just it's amazing how the the story goes on in the the the like how it progresses the the story how it progresses and continues and like the ending really shocked me but it was good and like my friend she was like okay I'm not going to tell you anything but there is a plot twist and like that was it I I borrowed another book from my my cousin one time and like everybody just if I want if if they want to gift me anything or give me anything they know that they should give me books cause like that's what I'm I really enjoy
KSA_Band_8_35629	okay so I'm going to talk about my best friend her name is Javeria and I know her since my high school and I'm going to tell you what the event was when I felt really proud it was during her graduation when she graduated from her university she studied in Middlesex University which is located in the knowledge village in Dubai and she started the schools called psychology and she was since the high school time she was really interested in learning something which is different and which is not regular like your business or accounting so to say so psychology it's really different study so she was really interested in pursuing that and apparently when she got that she got into the university she was very intrigued that she is getting to study the course that she liked and it was not easy the journey was not easy because it requires a lot of time and a lot of knowledge to understand psychology and behavior psychological behavior so she really worked hard and besides she was also working so it was not really easy for her to manage so she really worked hard and besides she was also working so it was not really easy for her to manage so during her graduation ceremony when she finally graduated she invited me over and that was really well because I always wanted to be a part of her success and in a time like that I wanted to be with her it was of the most precious time of our lives and it was really special for me as well because I always wanted to be a part of her success and in a time like that I wanted to be with her and it was the success was very important for her because she wanted to get into she went to do her master's also in the same subject in the same field so therefore she needed good grades in the psychology which she got so it was really important for her and she is normally a very hard-working person and she's very motivational and yeah she believed that hard work pays off and it really did during the graduation ceremony I could see her parents and some of our friends similar common friends they were also there and they were also quite happy and emotional to see
KSA_Band_8_35630	a person that I know who is a very intelligent to me as is the principal of my school that I work in I will tell you working the script script piece called Mustakhan Fatu I always find him to to be this very intelligent person how he runs this whole organization the whole institute it is a very big school to run so the reason why I think him as a very smart intelligent person is one of one of the one of the things is that he is more than a a leader his role he is a great person when it comes to leading I can describe him as a cheerleader because because cheerleader is always on the side of the team he never criticizes anyone and he's aged he's about sixty five years old and the most of his employees are millennials so to deal with us we we milennials we are the problem is that we need to be pampered we need to be we we need to be appreciated every small thing every big thing we every thing we achieve in life it needs to be it needs to be celebrated and he's this person who makes you feel like your work is valued your work is given value every small you do he will say well done that's something good he the respect he gives his staff you never meet him anywhere and he feels to give you proper handshake as to whether he cares as to whether you're good or not and
KSA_Band_8_36072	I was looking for sales sale steps information like sales training and stuff like that because I started to work in the sales careers since two thousand thirteen okay that time I was like nineteen years old okay so I was just trying to get more info about the sales and stuff just trying to increase my target and the type of information I found was very expensive especially when it comes to the straight line method that Jordan Belfort and some professionals in sales using nowadays which is the opening it's mainly about 80% of of closing the deal and closing it's about just twenty percent so that time I just got to know about those kind of info like for example should I I should start with building up the sales rapport with customer then I have to get his attention by saying much about by talking like about some steps about my the brand that I'm working for and stuff like that then the trust then getting the trust and then mixing the convincing skills with the product knowledge so I will end up having a sale and that led me to find some valuable information as as well about Philip Kotler book the marketing how to unleash some marketing or how to increase your knowledge about marketing as well and that time I was having the penetration I got the I got to know about the penetration and the skimming two ways of the penetrating the market so I got to know more about the Blackberries and the the difference between Blackberry and i Phone that time so when I got to found about the the Blackberry company they were just focusing on penetrating the market
KSA_Band_8_36625	so the person that I chose was sheikh Zayed bin Sultan who was the previous ruler of the UAE so the reason why I chose him is because he was such a great leader not only locally but also internationally he is or he was known everywhere by everyone and why I think this person was great because not only he knew how to transfer UAE from a desert into a green place unlike what other scientists and experts have already told him but he tried to fight against that and actually transform a desert into a modern green city an urban city and also one more aspect about him which I really liked was he was very much passionate and interested about his about the UAE nationals and he wanted to really develop them and provide a very nice place for them where they can be where they can feel comfortable they wouldn't really need to obtain their living or their income from outside he wanted to provide everything for them right here and also he also wanted actually he did a great achievement which which was uniting all seven emirates which if we go back in history we very you know they were isolated different countries he got them all together and they reunited so which which was an amazing thing
