 about this topic I the first experience that comes to my mind is my mother's birthday. and last year my mother was forty years old. and we ce we celebrate his birthday and set up birthday party for her. and we invite invited lots of relatives and her friends. and in the birthday party I cooked by myself. I also give my mother a birthday gift a golden watch which she really wants to get this watch because once when we went to a shopping mall she think it is quite beautiful. but it is very expensive so my mother didn't buy it at that time. how after that I save a lot of money.
