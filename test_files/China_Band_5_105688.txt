 about this topic I the first experience that comes to my mind is my mother's birthday. and last year my mother was forty years old. and we ce we celebrate his birthday and set up birthday party for her. and we invite invited lots of relatives and her friends. and in the birthday party I cooked by myself. I think it is really valuable because this is the first time I cook by my own So I really want to show my sincere. and I hope my mother can be better so I cook some dishes such as tomato beef soup and fried potatoes. so after that we have a great time. we sing the birthday song and dance in the living room. I think that it quite enjoyable. and after that we'll eat some cakes the birthday cakes. I also give my mother a birthday gift a golden watch which she really wants to get this watch because once when we went to a shopping mall she think it is quite beautiful. but it is very expensive so my mother didn't buy it at that time. how after that I save a lot of money.
