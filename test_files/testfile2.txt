 I want to talk about my grandpa who is a science teacher in a primary school. and when I was a kid my parents were too busy to look after me so my grandparents took the responsibility to take care of me. and he was quite welcomed by his children because they always wanted to hear the stories he shared and. as far as I know my grandpa devoted all his own life to the science career. and as his granddaughter I want to become a science teacher in the future just like him because I really admire him very much. and I think he is my role. I always said the example of him so I really like him very much.
