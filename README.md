# Lexical-Complexity
Automatically measuring lexical sophistication, lexical density, and lexical diversity

I have compiled all the codes for the lexical complexity measures we calculated before. Inside the folder, you can see the transcripts for all IELTS files we looked into before (all_txt_transcript.txt) and COCA word frequency. Those .py files are for calculating lexical complexity measures. 

You may need to install some packages in advance, including spaCy, pylats, taaled, pandas, and numpy. You can refer to the "Instructions_for_Installing_packages.txt" file for instructions about how to install them.

You can run "Lexical_Complexity.py" to calculate the measures all at once. Results will be written into a .txt file. Or, if you only want to calculate one category of them, you can just run the corresponding file; for example, you just need to run "Lexical_FreqBand.py" for frequency bands. You don't need to run "Switch_Tagging.py" at allâ€”it is imported to other codes. 

Feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions or questions when you play the codes around. We can also have a meeting if needed.
