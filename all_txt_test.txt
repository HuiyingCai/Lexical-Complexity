testfile1	about this topic I the first experience that comes to my mind is my mother's birthday. and last year my mother was forty years old. and we ce we celebrate his birthday and set up birthday party for her. and we invite invited lots of relatives and her friends. and in the birthday party I cooked by myself. I also give my mother a birthday gift a golden watch which she really wants to get this watch because once when we went to a shopping mall she think it is quite beautiful. but it is very expensive so my mother didn't buy it at that time. how after that I save a lot of money.
testfile2	I want to talk about my grandpa who is a science teacher in a primary school. and when I was a kid my parents were too busy to look after me so my grandparents took the responsibility to take care of me. and he was quite welcomed by his children because they always wanted to hear the stories he shared and. as far as I know my grandpa devoted all his own life to the science career. and as his granddaughter I want to become a science teacher in the future just like him because I really admire him very much. and I think he is my role. I always said the example of him so I really like him very much.
